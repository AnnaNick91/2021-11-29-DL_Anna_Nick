        "abstract": "S. R. Ranganathan, considered by librarians all over the world to be the father of modern library science, proposed five laws of library science in the early 1930s. Most librarians worldwide accept them as the foundations of the philosophy of their work and service in the library. These laws are: Books are for use, Every reader his or her book, Every book its reader, Save the time of the reader, and The library is a growing organism. The Five Laws of Library Science are some of the most influential concepts in the field. Since they were published in 1931, these five laws \"have remained a centerpiece of professional values...\" (Rubin 2004). These basic theories of Library Science continue to directly impact the development of this discipline and the service of all libraries. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The book has been reprinted over twenty-five times to meet the demand from libraries, students of library and information science and information professionals. In 2006 when DLIST (University of Arizona) placed a test version of the contents page and first chapter of the first edition of the book on the Internet, there were some 640 downloads in twenty-four hours. The \"five laws\" are equally valid in the present digital / information age as they have been in the conventional library environment. - Publisher.",

Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term \u201cdata science\u201d in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as \u201ce-science\u201d, \u201ce-research\u201d, \u201cdata service\u201d, \u201cdata curation\u201d, \u201cresearch data management\u201d or \u201cscientific data management\u201d or were not present in the Web of Science database.

Classic papers have been considered highly cited papers since last 10 years. Effective authors, institutions, universities, and countries on improving science can be identified by analyzing the papers. Therefore, this study aims to examine characteristics of classic papers of Library and Information Science (LIS). This study will use Scientometrics indicators. The study sample includes LIS classic papers. To gather the data, some databases such as Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus are applied. Excel and SPSS applications are used for descriptive and statistical analyses. The study data indicate that Scientometrics journal covers most classic papers on LIS (5 papers). 60\\% of the papers are written by more than one author. A paper of \u201cUsage Pattern of Collaborating Tagging System\u201d is highly cited paper of LIS with 3051 and 1308 citations on Google scholar and Scopus respectively. Analysis of authors\u2019 affiliation shows that American universities and institutions play considerable role in LIS classic papers. The data of statistical tests indicate that there is a positive significant correlation between citations of classic papers of Google scholar, Scopus and Web of Science.",

        "abstract": "Why were technical and technological experimentation and innovation, notably but not only by the European documentalists, substantially ignored in library science in the U.S.A. until after the Second World War? What would explain the intense but generally unsatisfactory controversy involving \"information science versus library science\" after the Second War World? Why was technical and technological innovation a vital force in librarianship in the late nineteenth century and in late twentieth century, but not, it seems, inbetween?\r\nAnalysis suggests that these three issues are closely related. One reason design and technology were of limited interest within library science in the U.S.A. in the second quarter of this century is that the most influential academic group was engaged in a vigorous, well-funded drive to develop a new school of thought with a new and different emphasis. By the 1930s the Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago and the European documentalists represented different schools of thought with different interests. Such differences are to be expected in any field that is alive.\r\nThe period after the Second World War was tension-filled, we suggest, because the dominant non-technological, social science oriented paradigm in U.S. library science, what we might call the school of Chicago, was challenged, rivalled, and changed by the return, in part from outside of library science, of a serious interest in design and technology. The matters that had interested the European documentalists emerged as a powerful force in U.S. library science twenty years later than in Europe. There were by now new and more powerful machines. There was, after a few years, a new name: \"information science\". The individuals leading the change commonly come from outside of librarianship and there was little association with war-devasted Europe. The European documentalists of the 1930s, who had written mainly in French and German, were largely forgotten.\r\nWe suggest that the temporary de-emphasis of design and technology contributed to a prolonged failure of identity and direction in the academic departments of library and information studies. What can be the purpose of a university-based professional school if research is not centered on the design of improved services? The absence of this central concern leads to a lack of purpose beyond sustaining a continuity of training in procedures, a preoccupation with \"professionalism\", and little convincing basis for a research agenda. Absent a central concern with design and technique, a coherent vision for research and for university-based professional education is also absent.",

This study shows that LIS scholars utilize a greater number and wider variety of research methods than before. Replacing the dominant positions that questionnaire survey and historical method previously held, content analysis, experiment, and theoretical approach have become the top choices of research methods in the field. This study also examines two recurring themes regarding research methods in the LIS field, namely, use of multiple methods in one study and adoption of the qualitative approach, but finds no conclusive evidence of increased implementation of either practice. More efforts in the form of education, training and advocacy are therefore needed to help LIS scholars gain a better understanding of research methods and make more informed decisions on research method selection and implementation in their scholarly endeavors.",

The question arises, how -- not if -- scientists can contribute to a sustainable development. As information plays an important role for development, information scientists should be included in this debate. However, is there a sustainable information science or an information science of sustainability? The purpose of this paper is to perform a mapping of publications in library and information science (LIS) directly dealing with sustainability and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review was conducted, enhanced by bibliometric analyses. For this purpose, 102 LIS journals and conferences were considered. The authors identified 81 publications dealing with sustainability and sustainable development and analyzed the concrete contents and methodological approaches of these. Findings: A large proportion of articles could be found dealing with sustainable development and libraries. Other publications focus on information and communication technology or information systems. Only few articles deal with further topics like government, urban development or scientific output. Research limitations/implications: Sustainability and sustainable development are complex topics. This work only considers literature whose title or keywords contain the string sustainab*. Originality/value: The presented work helps to get an overview on sustainability research and activities in the LIS field and additionally, potential research gaps may be identified. The authors call for more research in this area and concrete ideas to help develop a sustainable future.",

However, it remains unclear how it relates to information science within LIS schools. The purpose of this paper is to clarify this issue.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nMission statement and nature of both data science and information science are analyzed by reviewing existing work in information system and DS and drawing DIKW hierarchy. It looks at the ways in which information science theories bring new insights and shed new light on fundamentals of data science.\nFindings\n\nData science and information science are twin disciplines by nature. The mission, task and nature of data science are consistent with those of information science. They greatly overlap and share similar concerns. Furthermore, they can complement each other. LIS school should integrate both sciences and develop organizational ambidexterity. Information science can make unique contributions to data science research, including conception of data, data quality control, data librarianship and theory dualism. Document theory, as a promising direction of unified information science, should be introduced to data science to solve the disciplinary divide.\nOriginality/value\n\nThe results of this paper may contribute to the integration of data science and information science within LIS schools and iSchools.

More specifically, the paper works with Bardin\u2019s contingency analysis and follows Hj\u00f8rland\u2019s families of epistemologies for the categorization.,The analysis corroborates the observations made for the last ten years about the scarcity of studies on concept theory in LIS and KO. However, the study also reveals an epistemological turn on concept theory since 2009 that could be considered a departure from the rationalist views that dominated the field and a continuation of a broader paradigm shift in LIS and KO. All analyzed papers except two follow pragmatist or historicist approaches.,This paper follows-up and systematizes the contributions to the LIS and KO fields on concept theory mainly during the last decade. The epistemological analysis reveals the dominant views in this paradigm shift and the main authors and trends that are present in the LIS literature on concept theory.",

The goal is to plan a next-generation digital library and tools based on user priorities, using BHL as a test-bed for incorporating transcriptions, image searching, collection analysis and connections among museums, archives and biodiversity databases. Expanding Access to Biodiversity Literature positions BHL as an on-ramp to the national digital library infrastructure, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Partners provide tools, support, including training, copyright permissions and dollars, to enable small content providers to contribute via BHL to DPLA. Finally, Zooniverse (which builds and hosts citizen science projects) developed Science Gossip as an investigation into the communication of science by images in both the Victorian period and today. Images in BHL are tagged using crowdsourcing, for better access and a better understanding of the range of individuals who established early science.",

The main objective was to develop appropriate techniques of full-text analysis and to improve the efficiency of the individual methods in the mapping of science. The number of papers was, however, rather limited. In the present study, we extend the quantitative linguistic part of the previous studies to a set of five journals representing the field of Library and Information Science (LIS). Almost 1000 articles and notes published in the period 2002-2004 have been selected for this exercise. The optimum solution for clustering LIS is found for six clusters. The combination of different mapping techniques, applied to the full text of scientific publications, results in a characteristic tripod pattern. Besides two clusters in bibliometrics, one cluster in information retrieval and one containing general issues, webometrics and patent studies are identified as small but emerging clusters within LIS. The study is concluded with the analysis of cluster representations by the selected journals.",

        "abstract": "Conducting research and successfully publishing the findings is a goal of many professionals and students in library and information science (LIS). Using the best methodology maximizes the likelihood of a successful outcome. This outstanding book broadly covers the principles, data collection techniques, and analyses of quantitative and qualitative methods as well as the advantages and limitations of each method to research design. It addresses these research methods and design by discussing the scientific method, sampling techniques, validity, reliability, and ethical concerns along with additional topics such as experimental research design, ethnographic methods, and usability testing. The book presents comprehensive information in a logical, easy-to-follow format, covering topics such as research strategies for library and information science doctoral students; planning for research; defining the problem, forming a theory, and testing the theory; the scientific method of inquiry and data collection techniques; survey research methods and questionnaires; analyzing quantitative data; interview-based research; writing research proposals; and even time management skills. LIS students and professionals can consult the text for instruction on conducting research using this array of tools as well as for guidance in critically reading and evaluating research publications, proposals, and reports.The explanations and current research examples supplied by discipline experts offer advice and strategies for completing research projects, dissertations, and theses as well as for writing grants, overcoming writer's block, collaborating with colleagues, and working with outside consultants. The answer to nearly any question posed by novice researchers is provided in this book.",

        "abstract": "The importance and need for bilingual librarians is steadily being felt, but most library and information science (LIS) schools do not incorporate bilingualism in instruction. Rwanda is in a unique and complex setting in which bilingualism is being used in its LIS program. Such an education is ideal if our libraries are to have bilingual or multilingual librarians. However, this approach has many challenges when it comes to implementation, especially when the two languages of instruction do not happen to be the first language (L1) of the learner. This paper sets out to show how the bilingualism policy in Rwanda is affecting the LIS program and how it is being implemented in the program.",

The study reveals that engagement with open access is related to faculty rank and perceptions about tenure and promotion committee assessments of open-access publications. The perceived constraints of the tenure and promotion system within the academy impact LIS faculty engagement with open-access publishing in ways found in other academic disciplines. However, those who themselves engage with open access tend to assess publications in such venues more favourably than those without such publishing experience and are similarly more predisposed to believe that tenure and promotion committees would evaluate such publications favourably. Nonetheless, while in general it is clear that experience with open access reduces some of the concerns about the effects of this type of scholarly publishing on career opportunities, there remains a substantial amount of equivocacy among LIS faculty about open access.",

A recent study surveying research trends in the years 2002\u20146 at various information science departments worldwide has found that a clear trend was identified in Masters theses and doctoral dissertations of social aspects of information moving into the spotlight. The study found that only a third of the research that was tagged on the ProQuest Digital Dissertations database under either or both \u2018Library Science\u2019 and \u2018Information Science\u2019 was actually conducted at LIS departments. The current study aims to examine the remaining two thirds of these papers, conducted in non-LIS departments. This will contribute toward our understanding of the field and its future development. The research findings indicate that there is a relatively clear division of research topics between the studies conducted in various information studies departments and those conducted in other departments that study information. The main difference found is the opposite foci of LIS and non-LIS studies. While LIS scholars focus on the information user, other fields, headed by business administration, computer science, education and communication, focus on the system, on information technology, the information industry and the management of information.",

Douglas Waples's pragmatic empiricism and Bernard Berelson's behavioral science apparently won over librarianship, yet even psychologists are today questioning some of their basic tenets. Butler anticipated most of these challenges. I examine specific disagreements about (1) interior phenomena, (2) unambiguous definitions, (3) uninterpreted observations, (4) replicability of findings, (5) organization and cumulation of knowledge, and (6) prediction and control of behavior. Butler accepted science, but severely limited its role in librarianship. He argued that the profession needed a humane \"worldly wisdom\" to determine what libraries can and should be.",

It covers the whole area and illustrates it by looking at the experience of research workers in science communication and those whose task is to put science communication into practice. It deals with modes of informal communication such as science centres, television programs, and journalism and the research that informs practitioners about the effectiveness of their programs. It aims to meet the needs of those studying science communication as well as the increasing numbers of people who are employed in science centres and museums but have no formal training in this field. It is envisaged that the book will form a readily accessible source of expertise for communicators.",

In each of these periods, the author discusses three themes that have had a major influence in the development of libraries and LIS: the social, economic, scientific and political climate in China that influenced the development of libraries and information institutions, and LIS education, which supported the growing profession. In sum, this study reviews the accomplishment of library and information science in China from 1840 to 2009, and the significant efforts of people from different classes, and across several generations, combining the historical background, including the change of regimes, crisis from foreign invasion, and social progress.",

The 21st century has brought a lot of changes not only on the library and information services but also on the roles and expectations of the librarians and information professionals. The LIS professionals have new challenges because of unprecedented explosion of information and the application of information communication and mobile technologies in generation, dissemination and access of information. To cope with these problems, the modern library and information professionals need to change from the custodian of documents to the content managers. This paper examines (i) the importance of libraries and information centers; (ii) the transformation of libraries; (iii) temperature of the information world; (iv) the challenges faced by LIS professions (v) the new roles and skills of LIS professionals in this paradigm shift.",

A review of a number of state-of-the-literature reviews make the case that it has not been systematically explored or applied, and most LIS work elides the questions democratic theory raises. It is time to emend this and account for a relevant intellectual source which can more firmly ground LIS practice and research in normative terms. Toward that end, three productive wellsprings of democratic theory are reviewed: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Sheldon Wolin, and those working on democratic education (Amy Gutmann, Richard Brosio, Maxine Greene). The article concludes with an outline of some possible LIS questions and approaches drawn from these democratic theorists.",

To use the distinction made popular by the philosopher Isaiah Berlin applied disciplines tend to attract foxes and basic disciplines tend to attract hedgehogs. Michael Seadle has always identified himself as a fox, and his scholarship confirms this self-identification, as it has dealt with a broad array of approaches to library and information science problems, ranging from highly technical issues in long\u2010term digital archiving to ethnographic studies of the cultures of information users. This article identifies some hazards that successful foxes in applied disciplines must overcome, with respect to both individual scholarship and the management of groups of scholars in academic institutions.",

This paper presents a domain analysis of the library and information science discipline based on author co-citation analysis (ACA) and journal cocitation analysis (JCA). The techniques used for map construction are the self-organizing map (SOM) neural algorithm, Ward's clustering method and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The results of this study are compared with similar research developed by Howard White and Katherine McCain 1. The methodologies used allow us to confirm that the subject domains identified in this paper are, as well, present in our study for the corresponding period. The appearance of studies pertaining to library science reveals the relationship of this realm with information science. Especially significant is the presence of the management on the journal maps. From a methodological standpoint, meanwhile, we would agree with those authors who consider MDS, the SOM and clustering as complementary methods that provide representations of the same reality from different analytical points of view. Even so, the MDS representation is the one offering greater possibilities for the structural representation of the clusters in a set of variables. (Author abstract)",

It also examines the development of LIS from 1965 to 2005 in light of comparable data sets for 1965, 1985, and 2005. In both cases, the authors report (a) how the research articles are distributed by topic and (b) what approaches, research strategies, and methods were applied in the articles. In 2005, the largest research areas in LIS by this measure were information storage and retrieval, scientific communication, library and information-service activities, and information seeking. The same research areas constituted the quantitative core of LIS in the previous years since 1965. Information retrieval has been the most popular area of research over the years. The proportion of research on library and information-service activities decreased after 1985, but the popularity of information seeking and of scientific communication grew during the period studied. The viewpoint of research has shifted from library and information organizations to end users and development of systems for the latter. The proportion of empirical research strategies was high and rose over time, with the survey method being the single most important method. However, attention to evaluation and experiments increased considerably after 1985. Conceptual research strategies and system analysis, description, and design were quite popular, but declining. The most significant changes from 1965 to 2005 are the decreasing interest in library and information-service activities and the growth of research into information seeking and scientific communication.",

The results reveal that LIS researchers most frequently cite publications in their own discipline. In addition, half of all co-authors of LIS articles are affiliated with LIS-related institutes. The results confirm that the degree of interdisciplinarity within LIS has increased, particularly co-authorship. However, the study found sources of direct citations in LIS articles are widely distributed across 30 disciplines, but co-authors of LIS articles are distributed across only 25 disciplines. The degree of interdisciplinarity was found ranging from 0.61 to 0.82 with citation to references in all articles being the highest and that of co-authorship being the lowest. Percentages of contribution attributable to LIS show a decreasing tendency based on the results of direct citation and co-authorship analysis, but an increasing tendency based on those of bibliographic coupling analysis. Such differences indicate each of the three bibliometric methods has its strength and provides insights respectively for viewing various aspects of interdisciplinarity, suggesting the use of no single bibliometric method can reveal all aspects of interdisciplinarity due to its multifaceted nature.",

        "abstract": "The last several years have seen a marked upturn in society\u2019s use of electronic information as the internet has greatly altered the very nature of information access. Although academics and professionals in the library and information sciences (LIS) seek ways of improving the connection between individuals and information, public perceptions often question the importance of LIS-based work in a world where everything is so freely and readily available online. Therefore, the question becomes how relevant is the library and information science degree today in the world of electronic information? Using the theoretical framework of system theory and cybersemiotics, this chapter seeks to investigate the importance of LIS in the growing discipline of the digital humanities (DH). More specifically by focusing on data analytics, this chapter will demonstrate the practicality of LIS in an online environment and its necessity in giving information structure and meaning.",

First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among disciplinary were extracted from the subject category. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators and interdisciplinary communities were calculated. Third, the research topics of different interdisciplinary collaboration communities based on system keywords, author keywords, title and abstracts were detected.Findings The findings reveal that while the scope of disciplines involved in DH research is broad and evolving over time, most interdisciplinary collaborations are concentrated among several disciplines, including computer science, library and information science, linguistics and literature. The study further uncovers some communities based on closely collaborating disciplines and the evolving nature of such interdisciplinary collaboration communities over time. To better understand the close collaboration ties, the study traces and analyzes the research topics and themes of the interdisciplinary communities. Finally, the implications of the findings for DH research are discussed.Originality/value This study applied various informetric methods and tools to reveal the collaboration structure, patterns and themes among disciplinaries in DH research.",

One important aspect in this study is giving accurate definitions of the indicators for measuring uncited papers, uncited authors and uncited topics. It is found that for the period 1991\u20132010 ratios of uncited papers fluctuate within the interval 0,0.1. This ratio is relatively stable and not very high. Comparison of average number of pages, average number of references, average number of authors per paper and percentage of single-authored papers between cited and uncited papers shows that no matter the journal, the first three indicators' values for uncited papers are lower, while the values of the fourth indicator are higher, than the corresponding values for cited papers. The fact that almost all uncited authors in a journal published only one paper in this journal illustrates that a journal's uncited authors are the least productive authors in this journal. Yet, productive and highly cited authors also publish uncited papers. As to why some topics fall into the group of uncited topics, the hypothesis is that the combination of unfamiliar keywords forms an unfamiliar topic, a topic authors have elected not to study further. Another assumption is that some uncited topics fall outside the field of Library and Information Science. Retrieval results in the Web of Science for a set of uncited keywords and keyword combinations support this assumption.",

        "abstract": "Purpose\nThis paper is exploring research methods used in Library and Information Science (LIS) during the last four decades. Our goal is to compile a annotated bibliography of seminal works of the discipline used in different countries and social contexts.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWhen comparing areas and types of research, different publication patterns are taken into account. As we can see, data indicators and types of studies carried out on scientific activity contribute very little when evaluating the real response potential to identified problems. Therefore, among other things, LIS needs new methodological developments, which should combine qualitative and quantitative approaches and allow a better understanding of the nature and characteristics of science in different countries.\n\nFindings\nThe conclusion is that LIS emerges strictly linked to descriptive methodologies, channeled to meet the challenges of professional practice through empirical strategies of a professional nature, which manifests itself the preponderance of a professional paradigm that turns out to be an indicator of poor scientific discipline development.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis undoubtedly reflects the reality of Anglo-Saxon countries, reproduced in most of the recognized journals of the field; this issue, plus, the chosen instruments for data collection certainly slant the results.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe development of taxonomies in the discipline can\u2019t be left aside from the accepted by the rest of the scientific community, at least if LIS desires to be integrated and recognized as a scientific discipline.",

How often do we undertake research to improve our practice? This paper summarises content and feedback from a workshop undertaken at the LIANZA RLL1 Symposium, on Friday 27th May, 2016, at AUT campus, Auckland. The workshop examined research culture in the New Zealand Library and Information Science (LIS) sector. Specifically the workshop aimed to identify what constitutes research, reasons for undertaking research, barriers and challenges to undertaking research and possible solutions for creating a robust research culture within our own institutions and the Library and Information Science sector as a whole. Held at the end of the Symposium, the workshop provided an opportunity for discussion and reflection, not just on the Symposium itself, but on how we view ourselves as researchers individually and within our professional lives. This was a facilitated, discussion-based session where participants constructed their understanding through the shared experiences and knowledge of their colleagues in the LIS profession. The workshop produced ideas for fostering research mindedness and an evidence informed approach to practice as well as practical tips for fostering a robust research culture within the LIS profession.",

Links between web sites can be used in information science and social science research as a valuable source of evidence about online phenomena, and about online components of offline phenomena. Given a set of websites, the links between them many reveal interesting patterns of connectedness that could reflect issues of underlying human communication or information value. Link analysis is therefore a valuable tool for information science and social science researchers investigating the web, or other phenomena with an offline component. This book provides methods, guidelines and examples to guide researchers and students through a research project, in addition to reviewing a considerable body of previous work.<br><br>- Contains a complete link analysis methodology for information science and social science research.<br>- A strong online component includes software and instructions to allow complete link analyses (http://linkanalysis.wlv.ac.uk).<br>- Case studies include academic, business and commercial search engine applications.<br>- Practical chapters describe a range of related methods, software and data sources.",

In many studies the interpretative character of the objects of study seen as hermeneutic in itself. This is a misconception which draws the attention away from hermeneutics as a scientific point of departure and methodology used in the study of these processes. The problem is specifically present in studies making explicit or implicit reference to a modern view of science, while studies referring to LIS as a postmodern field of study seem to be more at ease with hermeneutics.\r\n\r\nPractical implications \u2013 Questions are raised on the fundamental use of hermeneutics in LIS. This may give rise to a deeper discussion on the scientific value and character of hermeneutics in LIS.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value \u2013 The paper questions the use of hermeneutics as a point of departure in LIS research by looking at the research made within the field. This perspective may increase understanding of the function of hermeneutics within LIS, something which is of value both for the research community and for students within LIS.",

        "abstract": "Students enter the library science graduate program with a wide range of information and technology skills. Today's graduate courses require students to be able to build web-based pathfinders, use social media, and search databases. This article examines the design and   development of an introductory course for incoming library science graduate students that personalizes instruction and ensures that each student is ready for the rigors of graduate school. Taken during the first semester of the program, this introductory course teaches information and technology skills and concepts that are core to library science. The author explores the process of creating a computer-based course that addresses the diverse needs of this student population. \n\nUsing a systematic approach to instructional design and development, the author outlines the steps in designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating an online, self-paced graduate course. Based on the Dick and Carey model, the process included identifying the instructional goals, conducting an instructional analysis, analyzing learners and contexts, writing performance objectives, developing assessment instruments, developing instructional strategies, developing and selecting instructional materials, designing and conducting formative evaluation of instruction, revising instruction, and designing and conducting summative evaluation. This process produced effective, efficient, and appealing instructional materials.\n\nLes \u00e9tudiants entament un programme d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures en sciences de l'information avec une panoplie d'habilet\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d'information et de technologie. Les cours d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures requi\u00e8rent aujourd'hui que les \u00e9tudiants puissent cr\u00e9er des guides en ligne, utiliser des m\u00e9dias sociaux et interroger des bases de donn\u00e9es. Cet article porte sur la conception et le d\u00e9veloppement d'un cours d'introduction qui est offert aux nouveaux \u00e9tudiants dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s en sciences de l'information et qui cherche \u00e0 individualiser la formation et \u00e0 s'assurer que chaque \u00e9tudiant se sent pr\u00eat pour les rigueurs d'une \u00e9cole d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures. Ce cours d'introduction, offert durant le premier semestre du programme, enseigne des habilet\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d'information et de technologie essentielles aux sciences de l'information. L'auteure relate le processus entrepris pour cr\u00e9er ce cours informatis\u00e9 qui r\u00e9pond aux divers besoins des \u00e9tudiants.\n\nEn utilisant une approche syst\u00e9matique pour la conception et le d\u00e9veloppement p\u00e9dagogique, l'auteure pr\u00e9sente les \u00e9tapes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conception, le d\u00e9veloppement, la mise en \u0153uvre et l'\u00e9valuation d'un cours de ma\u00eetrise en ligne adapt\u00e9 au rythme de chacun. Selon le mod\u00e8le de Dick et Carey, le processus permet d'identifier des objectifs d'apprentissage, mener une analyse p\u00e9dagogique, mener une analyse des apprenants et des contextes, \u00e9crire des objectifs de rendement, d\u00e9velopper des instruments d'\u00e9valuation, d\u00e9velopper des strat\u00e9gies d'enseignement, d\u00e9velopper et choisir du mat\u00e9riel didactique, concevoir et mener une \u00e9valuation formative de l'enseignement, r\u00e9viser l'enseignement ainsi que concevoir et mener une \u00e9valuation sommative. Ce processus a fourni du mat\u00e9riel didactique efficace, efficient et attrayant.",

        "abstract": "The concept of subject as expounded in library and information science (LIS) has been interpreted here from the standpoint of the concept of word in linguistics. Both the concepts have been thoroughly reviewed. It has been observed that the concept of subject so long conceived by different researchers in LIS is basically preceded by the concept of document. The description of subject, therefore in most cases, by default becomes incumbent within the concept of document. Since the document is a macroscopic entity, therefore document-dependent description of subject naturally portrays a macroscopic layout of the same. This paper attempts to develop a document-independent description of subject, which is based on semantically-related words within the domain of appropriate context. According to this new description the subject would eventually become definable as sets of well-defined and semantically-related words that may be regarded as microscopic description. It has also been found out that the seed of document-independent and word-based definition of subject was already sown in the concept of semantic field, a domain under the subject linguistics. This concept was incepted by Trier and subsequently modified by Lehrer. It has been logically established that the idea of foci incepted by Ranganathan and the idea of semantic field incepted and modified by Trier and Lehrer respectively are conceptually equivalent. A subject may therefore be described as sets of semantic fields and, in turn as sets of words.",

This re-examination is timely, fifteen years after this proposal was first made, in light of the development and wider acceptance of the PI concept itself, of advances in information technologies and changes in the information environment, and of the consequent, and continuing, need for LIS to re-evaluate its nature and role. We first give a brief and selective account of the introduction and consequent reception of the idea of PI as the basis for LIS; more detailed account of the origins of PI, and its initial reception within LIS, have been given by Furner (2010), by Fyffe (2015), and by Van der Veer Martens (2015). Then we consider whether such a basis is, in fact, needed, and, if so, what the other possibilities might be, and then examine five particular aspects of the relation between LIS and PI. The conclusions, for those who do not make to the end, are that such a foundation is indeed needed, and that PI is the most appropriate basis.",

        "abstract": "Two methods for curriculum review and revision are used to review and revise the Library and Information (LIS) curriculum at the University of Zululand, South Africa. Firstly, as an exercise in product analysis, a case study of the graduates of the University of Zululand between 1996 and 1999 was conducted. Graduates were traced to their current places of employment and interviewed together with their employers in order to determine whether the knowledge, skills and attitudes gained during training were adequate for their current job requirements. Secondly, a market-type analysis was conducted by scanning job advertisements in the field of library and information science appearing in a popular national weekly newspaper over a period of three years. Details regarding date and location of advertisement, type of employer, job details and job specifications and requirements in terms of qualifications, experience, knowledge, skills and attitudes were captured from this source and analysed. Whereas the aforementioned two methods still enjoy popularity, arguably, they alone do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the demand and supply matrix that can enhance effective and beneficial LIS education for service and employability of graduates. Evidently, the public sector and in particular the public and academic libraries, dominate this specific segment of the employment market in South Africa. Sound education in the fields of management, information and communication technologies, information searching, analysis and synthesis, as well as the ability to perform practical work is regarded as essential. The use of the aforementioned two methods exploits techniques which play a crucial verification role and which effectively supplement other methods such as reviewing existing curriculum and literature, consulting with colleagues and observing national and international trends as well as the focus-group method for academic programme development. Other intervening variables in the study are discussed. The paper addresses issues that can benefit theoretical and methodological issues in library and information science education and curriculum development. 1.",

        "abstract": "Collection development in college and university libraries most often occurs using longstanding traditional selection methods, such as favorable book reviews or local user needs. This study uses citation analysis as a tool to select books for the social science book collection in one academic library and compares the circulation of books using traditional methods to those books using citation analysis. The journal impact factor was used to determine those journals and authors cited the most in the disciplines of business, anthropology, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. If those authors published books, the books were purchased and circulation data on the books were tabulated and compared to books chosen using traditional methods. Findings indicate that books purchased using traditional methods of selection circulated more, except when individual disciplines were measured. In the areas of business, political science, and psychology, there was no significant difference in circulation statistics, and together both the traditional and citation analysis methods accounted for circulation of nearly 95% of the social science collection.

Beide Entwicklungstendenzen stellen die Notwendigkeit von Bibliothekaren als Vermittler zwischen Nutzern und Informationsquellen in Frage. Das Navigieren und Suchen nach Informationen in einer digitalen Welt, wenn die Welt selbst eine Bibliothek geworden ist, ist alles andere als trivial und die traditionellen Kompetenzen der Bibliothekare in Bezug auf das Suchen und Finden von Informationen sind so relevant wie eh und je. LIS-Ausbildungseinrichtungen sollten ihren Studenten auch die theoretische Werkzeuge zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen, die ihnen helfen, \u00fcber die Rolle und das Potenzial von Bibliotheken in Bezug auf die Herausforderungen einer nachhaltigen \u00f6ffentlichen Sph\u00e4re im digitalen und multikulturellen Zeitalter nachzudenken. LIS-Ausbildungseinrichtungen sollten ihren Studenten auch die historische Kontinuit\u00e4t und das Erbe von Bibliotheken als Institutionen der \u00f6ffentlichen Sph\u00e4re vermitteln.",

A scientometric analysis of international collaboration and growth of literature at the macro level.\u00a0Malaysian Journal of Library and Information Science,\u00a0Vol.20, no. 2: 41-50.The aim of this study is to analyze international collaboration and growth of literature at the macro level using the two new indices, Relative International Collaboration Rate (RICR) and Relative Growth Index (RGI). To illustrate these indices, literature on the field of tribology covered in SCOPUS during 1998 \u2013 2012 is used. As tribology is highly interdisciplinary in nature, which can be demonstrated by the indices, both indices can be used for other subject disciplines.",

DL-Harvest, a subject service for Library and Information (LIS), based on the aggregation of OAI-PMH compliant metadata from both institutional and disciplinary digital repositories, including dLIST, is described. Additionally, results from two studies that explored LIS journal publishers' stances towards self-archiving as expressed in copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) and the scholarly communication behaviors of LIS scholars, with regard to self-archiving and searching, are presented and some implications for the development of federated subject services are highlighted.",

The ISI databases (or Web of Science WoS), however, may no longer be sufficient because new databases and tools that allow citation searching are now available. Using citations to the work of 25 library and information science (LIS) faculty members as a case study, the authors examine the effects of using Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) on the citation counts and rankings of scholars as measured by WoS. Overall, more than 10,000 citing and purportedly citing documents were examined. Results show that Scopus significantly alters the relative ranking of those scholars that appear in the middle of the rankings and that GS stands out in its coverage of conference proceedings as well as international, non-English language journals. The use of Scopus and GS, in addition to WoS, helps reveal a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the scholarly impact of authors. The WoS data took about 100 hours of collecting and processing time, Scopus consumed 200 hours, and GS a grueling 3,000 hours.",

This undertaking has numerous highlights that are commonly not accessible in typical integrated library system, facilities like separate user interfaces for different users having different priorities. It also has a facility of admin login. Through this, the admin can monitor the whole system. In this system, users can see the list of books they have taken and its issue date, return date and also they can reserve the books online. The fine count is robotized with exactness. The application is intended to assist clients in maintaining and organizing the library. It is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users. It incorporates a recognizable, well thoroughly considered, and appealing UI joined with solid searching, insertion and reporting capacities. Generally, this task of our own is being created to help students as well as the staff to keep up the library in the most ideal manner conceivable and decrease human endeavors.

        "abstract": "In every college there will be a huge number of students who uses the facility of library to access or to refer different varieties of books to gain knowledge about subjects. Every Library maintains a register to maintain the data about members who entered library. Some colleges still use the traditional approaches of maintaining register, which is difficult to maintain, to check and to analyze data. So, we propose a new system in which students are passed through camera at entry point of the library where the students facial patterns are recognized and create the entry record into the database on clicking the button.

        "note": "This is a preprint of a paper published in the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology volume 58, issue 8, pages 1148-161, June 2007.  The well-documented limitations of journal impact factor rankings and perceptual ratings, the evolving scholarly communication system, the open access movement, and increasing globalization are some reasons that prompted an examination of journal value rather than just impact.  Using a single specialized journal established in 1960, about education for the Information professions, this paper discusses the fall from citation grace of the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science (JELIS) in terms of impact factor and declining subscriptions.  Journal evaluation studies in Library and Information Science based on subjective ratings are used to show the high rank of JELIS during the same period (1984-2004) and explain why impact factors and perceptual ratings either singly or jointly are inadequate measures for understanding the value of specialized, scholarly journals such as JELIS.  This case study was also a search for  bibliometric measures of journal value.  Three measures, namely journal attraction power, author associativity, and journal consumption power, were selected; two of them were re-defined as journal measures of affinity (the proportion of foreign authors), associativity (the amount of collaboration), and calculated as objective indicators of journal value. Affinity and associativity for JELIS calculated for 1984, 1994, 2004 and consumption calculated for 1985 and 1994 show a holding pattern but also reveal interesting dimensions for future study. A multi-dimensional concept of value should be further investigated wherein costs, benefits, and measures for informative and scientific value are clearly distinguished for the development of a fuller model of journal value.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is an innovative technology that could replace the current internet framework with a secure hash algorithm based on consensus based transactions in P2P networks. Library management is an important part of modern libraries. In an advanced library, Library management is currently done on RFID based kiosk implementation on KOHA or other Library management software to facilitate self check in and out. The problem of auditing and stocktaking of books, journals, periodicals is still a big issue despite library automation based on RFID. Blockchain based library management systems being transparent and immutable records are the answer to full proof auditing and stocktaking in the present setup of advanced libraries. Blockchain library management system restricts the use of copyright digital materials. Here we are demonstrating an illustration of library management using blockchain written using solidity language on Remix IDE. The blockchain implementation of Library management of books is successfully executed on Remix IDE. In this paper, we have given the source code of the smart contract and its snapshots for the blockchain library management of books using blockchain technology.

        "abstract": "The well-documented limitations of journal impact factor rankings and perceptual ratings, the evolving scholarly communication system, the open-access movement, and increasing globalization are some reasons that prompted an examination of journal value rather than just impact. Using a single, specialized journal established in 1960, about education for the Information professions, the author discusses the fall from citation grace of the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science (JELIS) in terms of impact factor and declining subscriptions. Journal evaluation studies in Library and Information Science based on subjective ratings are used to show the high rank of JELIS during the same period (1984-2004) and explain why impact factors and perceptual ratings either singly or jointly are inadequate measures for understanding the value of specialized, scholarly journals such as JELIS. This case study was also a search for bibliometric measures of journal value. Three measures, namely journal attraction power, author associativity, and journal consumption power, were selected; two of them were redefined as journal measures of affinity (the proportion of foreign authors), associativity (the amount of collaboration), and calculated as objective indicators of journal value. The affinity and associativity for JELIS calculated for 1984, 1994, 2004, and consumption calculated for 1985 and 1994 show a holding pattern; however, they also reveal interesting dimensions for future study. Journal value is multidimensional and citations do not capture all the facets; costs, benefits, and measures for informative and scientific value must be distinguished and developed in a fuller model of journal value.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is generally accepted among library and information science scholars that academic librarians can potentially assist faculty members with formal and informal scholarly communication processes. However, it is not clear to what extent faculty members and academic librarians are indeed aware of this potential and materialize it in the field. Following interviews with 20 faculty members and 15 academic librarians employed by a university or an academic college in Israel, questionnaires were constructed and delivered to 191 faculty members and 50 librarians. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that both the faculty members and librarians believed that academic librarians are potentially capable of contributing to scholarly communication processes. However, more faculty members than librarians expressed the expectation that librarians should be involved in scholarly communication, and were willing for this to be the case. Bridging this gap\u2014for example by appointing designated \u201cresearch librarians\u201d\u2014may contribute to the increased involvement of academic librarians in scholarly communication processes, which will benefit both the faculty members and the academic library.",

        "abstract": "Since the beginning of the 1990s, libraries have been undertaking a number of activities aimed at minimizing their negative impact on the environment. Those that show such activity are called \u2018green libraries\u2019. This term appears in scientific, professional and popular science literature, but its definitions are vague and ambiguous. A preliminary analysis of the content of publications dealing with the issue of green libraries shows a modest representation of theoretical and synthetic texts. This article aims to fill this gap. It has three goals: (1) clarification of the term \u2018green library\u2019, (2) conceptualization of the term \u2018green librarianship\u2019 and (3) determination of \u2018green librarianship\u2019 areas. To achieve them, first, an analysis of the environmental discourse on green libraries and green librarianship in library science literature was performed to abstract green library indicators. Then, these indicators were verified. The selection of the sample for research was deliberate. The materials were collected using the Library, Information Science & Technology Abstract (LISTA) bibliographic and abstract database. As a result, the number of green library indicators has been extended, which has made it possible to clarify the definition of this term. The definition of \u2018green librarianship\u2019 was then formulated, and the areas of green librarianship were indicated. Conceptualization of the terms \u2018green library\u2019 and \u2018green librarianship\u2019 constitutes the value of this article. The practical implication of the study is the expansion of the number of green library indicators. These indicators can be used to develop a codebook for the content analysis of documents in the discussed area. This article may also contribute to the development of methods for the evaluation of activities and development of green libraries.",

The citation data were drawn from references of each article of the three journals during 1998 and 2008. The Ulrich\u2019s Periodical Directory, Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat, and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. Quantitative results on the number of JASIST, IPM and JOD literature references, average number of references cited per paper, document type of cited literature and the journal self-citation rate are reported. Moreover, the highly cited journals and books, the main classes and subclasses of cited journals and books in papers of the three journals, the highly cited subjects in journals and books of library and information science were identified and analyzed. Comparison on the characteristics of cited journals and books confirmed that all the three journals under study are information science oriented, except JOD which is library science orientation. JASIST and IPM are very much in common and diffuse to other disciplines more deeply than JOD.",

        "abstract": "One of a librarian's more difficult jobs may be helping patrons in an elusive search for a \"good book.\" A variety of online sources are now available to help readers and librarians in their search, but the descriptive capabilities of the resources vary widely. Library and information science (LIS) literature has suggested many schemes and access points for fiction classification. This study compared the records for identical books in a variety of computer-mediated book information sources (CMBIS) in order to find out which resources utilized the access points identified in LIS literature. Results from this study suggest that online bookstores may be effective tools for librarians helping patrons find \"good\" books because of their increased use of access points. However, reader advisory databases, which contain reviews and subject headings, are occasionally more effective than online bookstores for identifying books published prior to the 1990s.",

Gatekeepers, who help link people with unknown information, are the ''humans'' in this human information-seeking process. The gatekeeping phenomenon has been studied in diverse disciplines and this article examines these research literatures to reveal that gatekeepers arise in discourse communities by different means, including cultural certification, informal nomination, or by virtue of their social positions. This multidisciplinary analysis of gatekeeping reveals that information practices are immensely contextual and contingent on the social environment. It enables and substantiates a collectivist perspective of library and information science (LIS). Moreover, this theoretical orientation also prompts us to apply social network analysis (SNA) to LIS in order to study and determine how the characteristics of social relationships and structures affect access to information resources.",

        "abstract": "Teacher and librarian collaboration is recommended in professional library and information science guidelines for school librarians. The guidelines suggest that when school librarians become an integral part of instruction, student learning improves. A proposed model of teacher and librarian collaboration identifies four facets of collaborative practices that are involved in teacher and librarian collaboration. The teacher and librarian collaboration model suggests that high level collaborative endeavors are most likely to have an effect on student learning. Exploratory factor analysis procedures were used to examine the structure of the Teacher and Librarian Collaboration (TLC-II) survey, an instrument developed using previously described collaborative endeavors between teachers and librarians. The analysis used responses from a sample of teachers from two school districts in the United States. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out on teacher scores ( N \u00a0=\u00a0194) for each of two sets of 16 questions regarding frequency of collaborative endeavors and importance to student learning. Cronbach's alpha was used to determine internal consistency reliability of the survey. Four factors emerged: Integrated Instruction, Integrated Curriculum, Coordination, and traditional cooperative roles between teacher and librarian. The factorial validity needs to be assessed with confirmatory factor analysis.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this article is to introduce a socially oriented approach to the analysis and representation of the social and intellectual structure of scientific fields. A sociological perspective is introduced as the theoretical basis to analyze scientific fields, and the social network framework is adopted to develop a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the organization of science. This approach is then applied to study the Spanish Library and Information Science community from 1999 to 2007. The underlying notion is that science is organized work, in which the pursuit of impact shapes the specific scientific organization. This generates mutual dependence and control among researchers, which may restrict access when formally communicating with other scientific communities. On the other hand, scholarly journals facilitate the coordination of new knowledge and serve as platforms for interaction among scientists. Consequently, the interaction of well-defined groups of homogenous researchers, concentrated around particular sets of journals, leads to the formation of cohesive (sub)groups tied together by the degree of similarity of the researchers' competence. An empirical test suggests that this consideration can accurately reveal a segment of the structure of the scientific field. This study therefore introduces a new approach for mapping the structure of scientific fields that differs from most existing methods, which are based on (co)citation.",

In particular, this study examined whether subject-based research type questions are answered as effectively as simple factual type questions, and whether local-specific questions are answered as effectively as non-local questions in the inter-institutional chat reference service. Effectiveness was assessed in terms of answer completeness and user satisfaction. The analysis was based on user surveys and corresponding transcripts of 415 chat reference transactions initiated by patrons of a public library system. The study found little difference in the effectiveness of question answering between subject-based research and simple factual questions. However, local-specific questions, such as circulation-related and inquires about local library services, were answered less completely and patrons expressed lower levels of satisfaction compared to non-local questions. These findings indicate problems and gaps in coordinating the inter-institutional chat reference service among participating libraries. Implications to design seamless services in the collaborative service were discussed.",

Meanings ascribed to the concept are investigated and if, and then how, the public library is shaped in relation to it. \r\nMethod. Library plans from five municipalities in Sweden are analysed and discussed in the light of previous research. Analysis. Bacchi's method `what\u00b4s the problem represented to be' is used to scrutinize what problem the public library is supposed to be part of the solution of. \r\nResults. Three policies represent the `problem' as a current threat to democratic values, safety and stability. By favouring social sustainability, the library contributes to robust communities and to enable trust. In two policies, sustainability is related to development and change. \r\nConclusions. When libraries are put forth as places encouraging users to take responsibility for social sustainability a tremendous responsibility is placed on individuals. Our suggestion for disrupting this argument is to recognise social unrest as a consequence of inequalities and unequal distribution of resources and to acknowledge pluralism and difference. Thereby, libraries may contribute to social sustainability and democracy by being places where social antagonism can be transformed to agonism.",

This article contributes to emerging Library and Information Science scholarship on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by arguing for the central roles played by public libraries in realizing its goals. The purpose is twofold. First, it overviews the agenda's history coupled with the start of a literature review of the Library and Information Science research on it. Second, it presents a conceptual framework in which to approach the agenda's goals and associated targets within the context of public libraries. The ultimate aim is to establish a base for and expand awareness of the UN 2030 Agenda within the Library and Information Science discipline, in addition to promoting the importance of public libraries in advancing sustainable development efforts generally and the agenda specifically.",

This understanding can enlighten information system design, interface development, and devising the information architecture for content collections. This article presents a review and foundation for conducting Web search transaction log analysis. A methodology is outlined consisting of three stages, which are collection, preparation, and analysis. The three stages of the methodology are presented in detail with discussions of goals, metrics, and processes at each stage. Critical terms in transaction log analysis for Web searching are defined. The strengths and limitations of transaction log analysis as a research method are presented. An application to log client-side interactions that supplements transaction logs is reported on, and the application is made available for use by the research community. Suggestions are provided on ways to leverage the strengths of, while addressing the limitations of, transaction log analysis for Web-searching research. Finally, a complete flat text transaction log from a commercial search engine is available as supplementary material with this manuscript.",

Collaboration between two authors was the dominant authorship pattern. Single-authored or more than 3-authored works were rare. The active authors were affiliated to a few institutions, with the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti Malaya accounting for the highest number of publications, either in the form of journal articles or papers in conference proceedings. The most active research areas include simulation system, control engineering, computer-assisted instruction, programming techniques, expert systems, asynchronous transfer mode, image processing, software engineering and digital signal processing and applications",

The purpose of this calculator is to provide insights into the topic to encourage more librarians to think about actions and implement them in libraries. Public Libraries are relevant cultural institutions and educational spaces with the mandate of free access to information, which play an important role in fulfilling the Agenda's 2030 goals for Sustainable Development. Societies in which it is possible for everyone to obtain the information they need at the right time are better placed to combat poverty and inequality, improve the health of their population, support culture, research and innovation. Not only the public access to information is important but also to use the library as a meeting space for education, workshops, lectures, expositions, courses, etc.",

This study examines current transaction log analysis methodologies and proposes a method for log cleaning, session definition, and query classification. A term definition method which is necessary for Korean transaction log analysis is also discussed. The results of this study show that users behave in a simple way: they type in short queries with a few query terms, seldom use advanced features, and view few results' pages. Users also behave in a passive way: they seldom change search environments set by the system. It is of interest that users tend to change their queries totally rather than adding or deleting terms to modify the previous queries. The results of this study might contribute to the development of more efficient and effective Web search engines and services.",

The results show that in 2000, 56.9% (and 47.3% in 1990) of the references originated from three fields: scientometrics and bibliometrics; library and information science; and the sociology, history and philosophy of science. When comparing the two periods, there is also a considerable increase in journal self-citation (i.e., references to the journal Scientometrics ) and in the percentage of references to journals.",

        "abstract": "This study explores whether ICT use is feasible in the rural areas of South Africa. Using the survey method, women aged 16\u201360 were sampled to include: Small-scale traders (58, 29.0%): Housewives/homemakers (48; 24.0%); Farm employees (25, 12.5%), Domestic workers (18; 9.0%): Educators/teachers (16; 8.0%): Students (15, 7.5%), Entrepreneurs managing large-scale enterprises (3, 1.5%), Clerical workers (9, 4.5%); Community development workers (6, 3.0%) and Preachers (2: 1.0%). These 200 respondents formed the sampling size. Sampling data was obtained from Census household data of the magisterial districts of Umlalazi i.e. Eshowe, Amatikulu, Gigindlovu and Mtunzini. Using the snowball technique women respondents, directly and indirectly connected to each other, were identified, and consequently interviewed. The survey results indicate that access and exclusion are still predominant issues, as while a meager average of 11(5.5%) respondents use modern technologies such as the computer/internet, more than half (115: 57.5%) of the respondents surveyed face problems ranging from affordability, to distance and time. Additionally, there is a marked correlation between the respondents' level of education, type of ICTs' accessed and information needs and purposes. It was observed that singularly, ICTs are insufficient for significant benefits to emerge.

Information and communications technology (ICT) can play an important role in facilitating the upgrading of education, health care, recreation and other services, by improving the quality of information available and by providing communities throughout the country with access to expertise and usable information. One of the objectives of the article is to indicate how the government envisaged and implemented its resolve to improve the communications technology infrastructure for the dissemination of usable information to rural disadvantaged communities by focusing on the centre approach. A second objective is to report on the present status--successes and failures--of the most important of these initiatives.

        "abstract": "The paper reports on the findings of a study that investigated the diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in communication of agricultural information among agricultural researchers and extension workers in Kenya. The study focused on the public agricultural sector and covered the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD). A survey research method, comprising a self-completed questionnaire and a structured interview schedule was utilized to gather data from the respondents who comprised of 159 agricultural researchers, 138 extension workers and 59 key informants. This was supplemented by observation and document review. It was found out that KARI and MoARD had adopted a wide variety of ICT tools and services in an effort to facilitate information sharing and exchange among agricultural researchers, extension workers, farmers and other actors involved in research and extension. These ranged from modern ICTs based on digital information and traditional ICTs based largely on analogue information waves. The ICT models adopted addressed the different kinds of information needs and communication problems encountered by agricultural researchers and extension workers. However, it was observed that despite the efforts to expand and modernize ICTs in the agricultural sector, its growth had been hampered by a number of constraints and challenges which require the intervention and interaction of all the stakeholders in the agricultural and ICT sector and also involvement of the government.

We develop a consistent and detailed link typology and terminology and make explicit the distinction among different Web node levels when using the proposed conceptual framework. As a consequence, we propose a novel diagram notation to fully appreciate and investigate link structures between Web nodes in webometric analyses. We warn against taking the analogy between citation analyses and link analyses too far.",

The purpose of this study is to identify the existing RDM policies. Specifically, the study compares and differentiates the RDM policies in three developed nations (USA, UK and Australia) to ascertain how the policies vary. The RDM policies of 100 universities from the three countries, that are present online &amp;nbsp;were retrieved and content analysis approach using NVivo and SPSS were performed. &amp;nbsp;The results from the analysis revealed that the common underlying facts of the policies were found in the areas of access, retention, sharing, storage and ownership. All the universities share the same core values in the management of their research. They exhibit that Data Management Plan (DMP) is essential. The study concluded that the differences in the data management are mostly issues of focus areas. More so, there is no fixed retention period for research data. To resolve the few differences identified, common criteria for data management is proposed for policy considerations to ensure compliance. Finding from the study is significant to developing countries as it adds to the discourse on data management policies. The study will also enable policy makers in developing countries to draw empirical evidence from the developed world on RDM and this will form a basis for policy direction.",

        "abstract": "The cataloging of musical materials has always posed challenges for librarians, requiring special treatment for classification and organization. Accurate description is critical for achieving high-recall retrieval and access by patrons. This study considers the challenge of music description through content analysis of the popular music websites AllMusic.com and Last.fm. The goal of the research was to gain a better understanding of how users describe their music collections. The findings in this study illustrate that hierarchical vocabulary structures are clearly evident within the Last.fm folksonomy. The findings also show that tagging data is more reliable in representing musical genre/subject than previously speculated, indicating that with proper analysis and coding, social tag data could be harvested to provide genre-level metadata for popular music titles. The work presented here contributes a methodology for further study of this topic, specific to music folksonomies and vocabularies, which may also be useful for other disciplines.",

        "abstract": "This dissertation is research in the domain of information science and specifically, the organization and representation of information. The research has implications for classification of scientific books, especially as dissemination of information becomes more rapid and science becomes more diverse due to increases in multi-, inter-, trans-disciplinary research, which focus on phenomena, in contrast to traditional library classification schemes based on disciplines.The literature review indicates 1) human socio-cultural groups have many of the same properties as biological species, 2) output from human socio-cultural groups can be and has been the subject of evolutionary relationship analyses (i.e., phylogenetics), 3) library and information science theorists believe the most favorable and scientific classification for information packages is one based on common origin, but 4) library and information science classification researchers have not demonstrated a book classification based on evolutionary relationships of common origin.The research project supports the assertion that a sensible book classification method can be developed using a contemporary biological classification approach based on common origin, which has not been applied to a collection of books until now. Using a sample from a collection of earth-science digitized books, the method developed includes a text-mining step to extract important terms, which were converted into a dataset for input into the second step\u2014the phylogenetic analysis. Three classification trees were produced and are discussed. Parsimony analysis, in contrast to distance and likelihood analyses, produced a sensible book classification tree. Also included is a comparison with a classification tree based on a well-known contemporary library classification scheme (the Library of Congress Classification).Final discussions connect this research with knowledge organization and information retrieval, information needs beyond science, and this type of research in context of a unified science of cultural evolution.",

In this paper, the author will discuss economic, demographic, and education trends in the United States and how these trends are changing libraries. As libraries evolve to meet the needs of our communities, new sets of skills for librarians are emerging. The most important questions to ask about the future of LIS education\u2014are we supplying LIS graduates with the appropriate training that ensures libraries remain relevant into the future? What is the future of the LIS degree? As libraries continue to evolve, will the LIS degree still be required or even desired?",

Evaluation of research quality is becoming more important In the field of library and Information science, as in other fields. This pilot study is a preliminary attempt to address issues associated with determining the quality of the published research in one area of library and information science, specifically school librarianship. A qualitative, naturalistic research design was used. On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, four approaches to evaluation were identified; they were generally supported through an analysis of the responses of the experienced evaluators. While many commentators have discussed research quality in library and information science as a whole and school librarianship in particular, there is little agreement about what represents quality in a research publication in this field or how quality can be recognized or measured. The quality of the journal in which an article is publishe",

However, regarding the Library Science field, specially the sector of Public Libraries, the roles and responsibilities of these institutions and librarians are little discussed in this scenario. This paper assumes that public libraries are institutions supported by the government, therefore they should be the first institutions to incorporate principles of sustainability and turn themselves into models of green cultural facilities in the country. This work presents a brief scenario of Brazilian public libraries, especially the Biblioteca Parque do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, the only facility of its kind that has achieved the Gold LEED Environmental Certificate. It also discusses the Ministry of Environment's Sala Verde project, which offers a collection of environmental books which aim at fostering the development of green rooms and their patrimony for environmental education and sustainability in Brazilian libraries. This study also suggests national guidelines for the implementation of public policies for green and sustainable libraries in the country. The objective is to stimulate such implementation in local and state governments.",

It draws from Web of Science records on papers authored by researchers at Spanish institutions and published under the category \u2018Information Science & Library Science\u2019 between 1985 and 2014. Two analytical techniques were used, one based on co-keyword and the other on document co-citation networks. Burst detection was applied to noun phrases and references of the intellectual base. Co-citation analysis identified nine research fronts: \u2018digital rights management\u2019, \u2018citation analysis\u2019, \u2018translation services\u2019, \u2018bibliometric analysis\u2019, \u2018co-authorship\u2019, \u2018electronic books\u2019, \u2018webometrics\u2019, \u2018information systems\u2019 and \u2018world wide web\u2019. The most recent trends in the subject areas addressed in Spain were found to lie in metrics-related sub-specialities: the h-index, scientific collaboration, journal bibliometric indicators, rankings, universities and webometrics.",

The laws continue to be extensively cited even today suggesting their continued relevance. This paper attempts to interpret the five laws in the present day context of information abundance, digital revolution, currently available resources and services, and user behaviours. The idea has been to suggest how libraries and librarians can better connect to those behaviours. After examining the changing roles of the Five Laws on the basis of findings of recent research, the paper suggests reordering and reframing of the Five Laws of Library Science. A number of recommendations for realizing the intent of the laws have also been made.",

        "abstract": "It cannot be overemphasized that changes in concepts  have  far  more  impact  than  new  discoveries(Mayr, 1997, p. 98)Concept theory is an extremely broad, interdisciplinary and complex field of research related to many deep fields with very long historical traditions without much consensus. However, information science and knowledge organization cannot avoid relating to theories of concepts. Knowledge organizing systems (e.g., classification systems, thesauri, and ontologies) should be understood as systems basically organizing concepts and their semantic relations. The same is the case with information retrieval systems. Different theories of concepts have different implications for how to construe, evaluate, and use such systems. Based on ldquoa post-Kuhnian viewrdquo of paradigms, this article put forward arguments that the best understanding and classification of theories of concepts is to view and classify them in accordance with epistemological theories (empiricism, rationalism, historicism, and pragmatism). It is also argued that the historicist and pragmatist understandings of concepts are the most fruitful views and that this understanding may be part of a broader paradigm shift that is also beginning to take place in information science. The importance of historicist and pragmatic theories of concepts for information science is outlined.",

The book talks about the problems of knowledge and inference for the purpose of merging artificial intelligence and library science. \nThe book begins by clarifying the concept of \"\"knowledge\"\" from many points of view, followed by a chapter on the current state of library science and the place of artificial intelligence in library science. Subsequent chapters cover central topics in the artificial intelligence: search and problem solving, methods of making proofs, and the use of knowledge in looking for a proof. There is also a discussion of how to use the knowledge system. The final chapter describes a popular expert system. It describes tools for building expert systems using an example based on Expert Systems\u2014A Practical Introduction by P. Sell (Macmillian, 1985). This type of software is called an \"\"expert system shell.\"\" This book was written as a textbook for undergraduate students covering only the basics but explaining as much detail as possible.",

This article presents a panoramic view of policies with which University of Buea Library is run or managed and the extent to which such library policies assist in the strategic control of crime wave in the said library. With the use of descriptive survey research design and purposive sampling technique questionnaire which was the sole instrument for data collection for the research was administered to 15 librarians in University of Buea Library. When subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, the collected data revealed that mutilation, theft, hiding of books and answering of phone calls were among principal crimes disrupting proper librarianship in University of Buea Library. Consequently, it was recommended that rules and regulations prohibiting the acts of making answering of mobile telephone calls, mutilation, theft and hiding of library books should be strictly implemented.

In-depth interviews with ten professors from a social science discipline and a natural science department provided descriptions of their information seeking involving material sources and their perceptions of the library collection. Participants used the following parameters in perceiving the library collection: instant availability, selectivity, physical collocation, catalog representation, user privilege, material stability, and further parameters for subcollections, including subject and format. Additional components that were important in the users' information environment were personal collections, the Internet, and other institutions' collections. Analysis revealed that collections provided valuable functions, such as collocating sources for convenience and saving time and money, selectivity, narrowing the search scope to increase precision and ease of use, presenting choices, and assisting in clarification of information need. The user's perspective demonstrates the need for user-centered and flexible, rather than library-centered and fixed, collection structures.",

Data for this study was assembled by searching the Library, Information Science, and Technology Abstracts database for articles that have used the term `knowledge organization' or `information organization' in their titles, abstracts, or descriptors. Taken as a whole, these preliminary results suggest that the content of the KO literature has shifted since the advent of the web. Although classic KO principles remain prominent throughout both eras, the presence of new content areas, such as metadata, denotes a shift in KO trends. In the pre-web era, the literature was related in large part to indexing and abstracting. In contrast, cataloging and classification issues dominate the landscape in the post-web era. The findings from this paper will be of particular use to those interested in learning about upcoming trends in the KO literature.",

Scientific, technological, and medical journals are the first publications to be completely transformed from print to digital format but monographs are beginning to appear in digital format as well and soon all communication and publishing of scientific information will be entirely electronic. In fact, this change is affecting all components of the scientific enterprise, from personal correspondence and laboratory methods to peer reviewing and the quality assessment of scientific research. Along with these radical and rapid changes in information presentation and distribution are coincident changes in the expectations of both the public and other scientists, with both groups demanding ever more rapid, open, and global access to scientific information than has been available in the past. The consequence of this revolution in the mechanics of communications technology is threatening the very existence of a number of highly regarded institutions such as intellectual property, commercial publishers, scientific societies, and academic libraries and might soon begin to threaten even the traditional university.",

Itemizing materials in a bibliography is a claim to familiarity with the content of those materials. Bibliographic anomalies are apparent in papers by Elfreda Chatman, published in library and information science journals. misspellings and disjunctive uses of material suggests that Chatman is unfamiliar with the literature bases she invokes. Working through texts and accompanying bibliographies, this article shows how the entailments of research programs that Chatman claims to use can be reflected back onto her own work. The article provides suggestions on how to make interdisciplinary studies more accountable to academic communities.",

Green Library is not only a thought, but also a movement towards the sustainable development of libraries all over the world particularly in development countries. The green library movement involves librarians, library staff, library users, libraries that are dedicated to greening libraries and reducing the environmental degradation. ``Feed Green to Read Green'' is a sign of ``as people take care their body for a better health, they should take care their library's health (development).

The diversity of disciplines positions iSchools to contribute to data science research and workforce needs in both ordinary and novel ways. This workshop will provide a needed forum for international dialog on the iSchool community's engagement with data science. The goals are to: 1) share iSchool developments in data science education and research, 2) articulate unique contributions and opportunities for iSchools in the data science, and 3) lay a foundation for continued international dialog among iSchools pursuing or seeking to pursue data science. A final report will summarize position papers, synthesize workshop discussions, outline action items for continued iSchool work in this area. An overall output, will be the foundation for a cohesive framework to enable the iSchool community dialog on data science.",

        "abstract": "We present VegasFlow, a new software for fast evaluation of high dimensional\r\nintegrals based on Monte Carlo integration techniques designed for platforms\r\nwith hardware accelerators. The growing complexity of calculations and\r\nsimulations in many areas of science have been accompanied by advances in the\r\ncomputational tools which have helped their developments. VegasFlow enables\r\ndevelopers to delegate all complicated aspects of hardware or platform\r\nimplementation to the library so they can focus on the problem at hand. This\r\nsoftware is inspired on the Vegas algorithm, ubiquitous in the particle physics\r\ncommunity as the driver of cross section integration, and based on Google's\r\npowerful TensorFlow library. We benchmark the performance of this library on\r\nmany different consumer and professional grade GPUs and CPUs.",

By 1999 it had evolved into an operational digital library, offering a well-defined set of services to a broad user community, based on an extensive collection of georeferenced information objects. The vision of ADL continues to evolve, as technology makes new services possible, as its users become more sophisticated and demanding, and as the broader field of geographic information science (GIScience) identifies new avenues for research and application.",

Gl\u00e4nzel and Schoepflin () first raised the issue of bibliometric standards in bibliometric research and this concern has been echoed by several additional bibliometric researchers over time (Braun, ; Gl\u00e4nzel, ; Abbott, Cyranoski, Jones, Maher, Schiermeier, & Van Noorden, ; Lane, ; Nature, ; van Noorden, ; Wallin, ). We compare the characteristics of articles published within and outside the Library and Information Science (LIS) field, including the relative impact and the affiliation of the contributing authors. We find that although the visibility of bibliometric articles within LIS is higher, it is not significant. However, a statistically significant growth in the number of articles written by authors without a bibliometric affiliation was found. This article provides an independent empirical investigation of publication trends potentially underlying Gl\u00e4nzel and Schoepflin's () concerns regarding the misuse of bibliometric results, and the inaccurate dissemination of concepts, results, and methods outside of the bibliometric field.",

These tools have categorized in two sections: \"Subject indexing\" and \u201cClassification schemes\u201d; Next, the methodology of developing indigenous means and tools are presented in detail.

There is a cycle of activities which provides the context for the library's existence, and which the library supports through its various roles of information access, discovery, storage, dissemination and preservation. This paper describes the role of digital library systems in the undertaking of science, and in particular in the context of the recent developments of the Grid for computer-supported scientific collaboration and Virtual Universities for computer-supported education. This paper focuses on a specific framework, the Dynamic Review Journal, which supports the development and dissemination of documents by assisting authors in collating and analysing experimental results, organising internal project discussions, and producing papers. By bridging the gap between the undertaking of experimental work and the dissemination of its results through electronic publication, this work addresses the cycle of activity in which a digital library rests.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. A review of some studies about Latin-America scientific output in Library and Information Science is conducted. This study probes the lack of research on this topic from the perspective of domain analysis. Methods and materials. The main source was periodicals categorized under Information Science & Library Science as found in the Journal Citation Reports (1992-2002). The Social Science Citation Index (1966-2003), online version, was utilized. For subsequent modifications to the downloaded files the Bibexcel program was used. Analysis. The scientific output in this field is analyzed on the SSCI data base, during the period cited above. This analysis presents some bibliometric indicators, such as, co-authorship, output, the most productive departments or institutions. This analysis is a continuation of a previous study on the international visibility of Iberian-American's scientific output. Conclusion. Latin-America's scientific participation in this field is minimal. This is the reason why the most productive countries, generally speaking, in the area are highly regarded. The most productive institution is the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, where the Centro de Informacion Cientifica y Humanistica-CICH as well as the Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Bibliotecologicas-CUIB, are well recognized.

Subject headings provide valuable access points to library resources during search and discovery for patrons. Many librarians will be familiar with the more widely used controlled vocabularies, like those maintained by national libraries or major professional organizations. More recently, there has been an increasing shift toward specialized vocabularies maintained by independent entities intended for much narrower use. While there is valid criticism of the nature or content of controlled vocabularies, they will likely continue to be an important feature in information organization.",

        "abstract": "The term \u201cmapping knowledge domains\u201d was chosen to describe a newly evolving interdisciplinary area of science aimed at the process of charting, mining, analyzing, sorting, enabling navigation of, and displaying knowledge. This field is aimed at easing information access, making evident the structure of knowledge, and allowing seekers of knowledge to succeed in their endeavors. Although thousands of years old, this area has undergone a sea change in the last 15 years, a change fostered by an explosion of the amount of information available, the accessibility of that information due to electronic storage, and the new techniques of analysis, retrieval, and visualization that are made possible by vast increases in computational storage capacity and processing speed and power. Many of us are so involved in the new ways of accessing knowledge that we have forgotten how recent is the change to computerized knowledge retrieval with search engines operating on the World Wide Web. Remarkable as these changes are to date, they are only a hint of the transformation to come. The Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium on Mapping Knowledge Domains, held at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering in Irvine, CA, May 9-11, 2003, was designed to showcase the ongoing developments in this transformation and provide pointers toward the directions it will move.\r\n\r\nThe changes that are taking place profoundly affect the way we access and use information. Scientists, academics, and librarians have historically worked hard to codify, classify, and organize knowledge, thereby making it useful and accessible. The day is fast approaching when all this knowledge will be coded electronically, but mixed in a vast and largely disorganized and often unreliable sea of mostly recent information. Fishing this sea for desired information is presently no easy task and will continue to increase \u2026",

A mobile application dealing with inventory is presented in this paper. The application supports scanning barcode labels on the books and retrieving data about those books. For every book, the application enables changing data about status and call number of the book. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the case study of developing application for the Android platform and this application is part of the BISIS library management system. Findings By analysing procedure of an inventory in the library of the Faculty of Science, University of Novi Sad, it is concluded that this procedure is tedious and can be simplified. In order to make this procedure more efficient, a mobile application enabling search and update of bibliographic records has been developed. That application communicates with the BISIS library management system using a specially designed service. Practi...",

The challenge is to use social media for green companies by giving the value to the consumer in the comparison of products and services The aim of this paper is to review previous study that underpins a seamless integration of library green initiative using social media.In order to achieve this aim, we tackle the literature to incorporate social media and library green initiative. The results can lead to some new evaluation methods in green technology from library perspective. The outcome will offer an enormous opportunity to advance the science of data analytics so that future researchers will have a new understanding on what is needed to use social media as a tool to improve library sustainability. The conduct of this survey will ensure the projects agility in responding to unfolding events, and substantially enhance its ability to engage in and impact on green technology and societies.",

The work intends to be a line of thought that meets the goals for sustainable development outlined by the United Nations and the International Federation of Libraries Association - a proposal for the inclusion of libraries and information in the post-2015 agenda. The research of green libraries around the world demonstrated a growing number that applies environmental sustainability criteria in their strategic and management action. Emerging academic research, conferences and seminars devoted to the theme proposed revision of the academic curriculum in Library Information Science. Library professional associations worldwide are creating working groups and encourage debate on environmental sustainability and the concept of \"global library\". To understand the Portuguese situation in this matter, questionnaires were sent to all municipal libraries in each district, resulting in a sample of 84 public libraries.

Often libraries have shown their agreement with green movement ideas through the construction or renovation of green libraries. However, with decreasing budgets, many libraries cannot afford new construction or the fees associated with becoming green certified. How then can libraries continue to support the green movement while on a budget? This chapter argues that while green certification is a good goal to have, if libraries would switch their focus to the wellness of their employees and patrons instead, then libraries could still have a positive impact on the well-being of their communities and enact healthy and environmentally sound initiatives, while also staying within their budget.",

This article reports on a survey of 126 academic librarians concerning their perspectives toward Facebook.com, an online network for students. Findings suggest that librarians are overwhelmingly aware of the \"Facebook phenomenon.\" Those who are most enthusiastic about the potential of online social networking suggested ideas for using Facebook to promote library services and events. Few individuals reported problems or distractions as a result of patrons accessing Facebook in the library. When problems have arisen, strict regulation of access to the site seems unfavorable. While some librarians were excited about the possibilities of Facebook, the majority surveyed appeared to consider Facebook outside the purview of professional librarianship.",

Relevant data were first collected from Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index for the period 1987-1997. The results of co-word analysis on the data were compared with similar data obtained from three thesauri: Library and Information Science Abstracts thesaurus, Library of Congress Subject Headings and Thesaurus of Information Technology Terms. The differences detected between them indicate that the search variety may be increased by combining co-word analysis with the use of traditional thesauri. Subsequently, the results of co-word analysis were compared with each other for two different periods (1987-1991 and 1992-1997). The changes among them were identified, implying that co-word analysis may be used directly to identify dynamic changes in its chosen domain area, thereby providing better up-to-date information to aid the information search process.",

The disciplines of references and co-authors from five information science journals were analysed. Furthermore, Brillouin\u2019s Index was adopted to measure the degree of interdisciplinarity. The study revealed that information science researchers have cited the publications of library and information science (LIS) most frequently. The co-authors of information science articles are also primarily from the discipline of LIS, but the percentage of references to LIS is much higher. This indicates that information science researchers mainly rely on publications in LIS, and they often produce scientific papers with researchers from LIS.

Relevant data were first collected from Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index for the period 1987-1997. The results of co-word analysis on the data were compared with similar data obtained from three thesauri: Library and Information Science Abstracts thesaurus, Library of Congress Subject Headings and Thesaurus of Information Technology Terms. The differences detected between them indicate that the search variety may be increased by combining co-word analysis with the use of traditional thesauri. Subsequently, the results of co-word analysis were compared with each other for two different periods (1987-1991 and 1992-1997). The changes among them were identified, implying that co-word analysis may be used directly to identify dynamic changes in its chosen domain area, thereby providing better up-to-date information to aid the information search process.",

        "comment": "I have a copy\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA good review paper.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUser-centered:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The oldest and most conventional approach to design that includes users in the design process can be called user-centered design. Although linked with all forms of design that include users, historically, user-centered design refers to a process undertaken once the technology has already been developed and released onto the market.\" (p 141)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvolves users in post-production product testing and evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, this approach focuses on the impact of the technology on users, enabling the development of future versions of the existing technology or the design of completely new technologies. Because the users, whether adult or child, are only involved after the technology has been designed, they have little or no control in the process. User-centered design is still employed as a tool to consider the future of new technologies and new educational uses of technology\r\n\r\n(Druin, 2002).\" (p 141)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00d6ne major drawback of user-centered design is that the users\u2019 involvement is limited. They cannot themselves initiate any changes but only reveal any design shortcomings. Another drawback directly associated with involving children in this approach is that the research methods such as task activities and questionnaires may be boring and/or difficult for children to understand. An advantage though is that children can be incorporated into the research quite easily and in large numbers. Researchers may perform comprehensive studies with many children, producing remarkable results\" (p 141-142)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nContextual design:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContextual design focuses on understanding the users practices in their natural settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The aims of CD are to reveal the details and motivations of people\u2019s work, to make the customers and their work needs real to the designers, to use customer data as the basis of decision making, and to create a shared understanding of the data by researchers and users. Its purpose is to reveal who the customers really are and how they work. CD calls for researchers to collect data in the users\u2019 own environment by observing them performing typical activities. The researchers usually record observational data by taking field notes and/or using audiovisual technologies. Even when conducting one-on-one interviews with the users at the workplace to develop a deeper understanding of the users\u2019 work, interaction between researchers and users is minimal since usually the researchers ask questions only for the purposes of clarification.\" (p 142)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD starts by 'work modelling', using five differnt models to describe the flow and structure of activity in the workplace. These models are constructed from observations in different settings where the designed product is to be used. The next step is called 'consilidation' and involves extraction of common patterns across settings. The final phase of CD involves developing a low-tech prototype mock-up of the system and testing it with users. This allows the designer to flush out critical errors before sinking into large prodction costs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nParticipatory design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Participatory design (PD) originated in the Scandinavian workplace and promotes workers\u2019\r\n\r\ncontrol over their work and their lives. Its premise is that users are the best qualified to\r\n\r\ndetermine how to improve their work and work life and that their perceptions about\r\n\r\ntechnology are as important as technical specifications (Carmel, Whitaker, & George,\r\n\r\n1993). A highly iterative approach, goals, and the strategies for accomplishing them are\r\n\r\ncontinually refined. PD looks to compromise rather than consensus as an end goal. It follows\r\n\r\nflexible practices and general guidelines; there is no standard set or ordering of practices, nor\r\n\r\nis there a set structure for the time frame of the project. As Fleming notes, \u2018\u2018Through this\r\n\r\napproach, \u2018users move out of roles such as observer, approver \u2018knowledge repository\u2019 . . . and\r\n\r\ninto roles such as peer co-designer, design owner, expertise contributor, and self-advocate\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\n(Fleming in Bilal, 2002, p. 208). In PD, users move from extrinsic roles such as observer to\r\n\r\nintrinsic roles such as peer codesigner.\" (p 143)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCooperative inquiry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Developed by Druin and her colleagues at the University of Maryland, cooperative inquiry is a combination of techniques from different design methodologies that have proven useful when working with children. Based on the cooperative design practices of Scandinavian countries and the participatory design practices of the United States, the critical outcome of cooperative inquiry is design-centered learning. Cooperative inquiry is grounded in human\u2013 computer interaction (HCI) research and theories of cooperative design involving a multidisciplinary partnership with children, field research, and iterative low- and high-tech prototyping. A truly cooperative approach, cooperative inquiry treats children as full design partners\u2014equals to the professional adult designers on the team. Professional designers and users (children) of the technology are partnered in intergenerational design teams with the understanding that full participation of users requires training and active cooperation.\" (p 144)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInformant design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Developed by Scaife and his colleagues at Sussex University in England, 'informant design' was introduced to address some of the perceived problems with user-centered and participatory design techniques when working with children. In conventional user-centered\r\n\r\ndesign, users are involved only as evaluators or testers at the end of the design process, and therefore their feedback is based on reaction rather than initiation. Furthermore, in user centered design, it is up to the designers to translate and interpret the users\u2019 reactions and this can be an inaccurate practice. The perceived problem with participatory design is its\r\n\r\npromotion of equality for all team members. Scaife considers this approach to be effective for a team composed of adult users who can view each other as peers but infeasible when dealing with children. He does not believe that children have the time, knowledge, or\r\n\r\nexpertise to participate fully in the collaborative participatory design model (Scaife, Rogers, Aldrich, & Davies, 1997).\" (p 147)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLearner-centered design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Soloway, Guzdial, and Hay (1994), expanding upon the idea that the long-term goal of computing is to make people smarter, decided that the HCI community needed to move from\r\n\r\nthe traditional 'user-centered' design to what they term learner-centered design. This approach assumes that everyone is a learner, whether a professional or a student. In fact,\r\n\r\nSoloway et al. describe professionals as 'students who happen to learn outside of a classroom' (p. 39). Therefore, the main focus of learner-centered design is to ensure that the interface design is adapted to the interests, knowledge, and styles of the learners who use\r\n\r\nthe software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoloway et al. (1994) believe in the educational philosophy of 'learning by doing.' For them, 'when learning is divorced from doing a meaningful task . . . then learning becomes just another chore . . .' (p. 40). The three issues addressed by user-centered design are tasks (what does the software need to do?), tools (what tools are provided to handle these tasks?), and interfaces (what is the interface to these tools?). The issues at the heart of learner-centered design are understanding (how will the learner learn the practice?), motivation (how can software motivate a learner?), diversity (every learner is different\u2014what kind of software can\r\n\r\nbe developed that supports this?), and growth (the learner changes but the software does not).\" (p 148)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What can be concluded about these various design theories based upon the rather limited number of applications in the information technology field? It has become obvious that as children\u2019s likes, dislikes, wants, and needs in relation to technology become more and more sophisticated, they must be involved in the design process in a meaningful way. Certainly, few if any current researchers would dispute the value of including children in at least some aspects of the design of children\u2019s technologies; the dispute lies in the methods for accomplishing this. The participatory design theories discussed in this article each have the potential to be adapted to include children as active participants. However, picking and choosing different aspects from these theories that can better facilitate the involvement of children will go a long way in achieving the usability goals set by experts such as Nielsen, Rubin, and Shneiderman, as well as other goals significant to the design of information technologies. As Druin and Large have shown with their work with intergenerational design teams, reinforced by that of Hanna et al. (1997, 1999) and Theng et al. (2000), involving children as much as possible in the design process initiates and facilitates innovations and improvements to the final design that might not otherwise have been thought of by adult designers. The research has shown, however, that there are limitations to involving children in all aspects of the design process. Children often have difficulty in expressing ideas (Large et al., 2003a, 2003b, in press) and learning goals they have not yet met and as a result may be unable to participate fully as design partners and can contribute only in an informant role (Scaife & Rogers, 1999). In terms of working as an intergenerational design team, children are often very conscious of age differences, no matter how slight (Nielsen, 2002), and may need to be separated according to age (Hanna et al., 1999) to be able to participate effectively. Other difficulties in establishing intergenerational design teams are the dynamics of power relations between adult and child, and directly related to this, the fact that some professional designers may have difficulty accepting children as peers (Scaife & Rogers, 1999; Scaife et al., 1997). However, it should be noted that many of these drawbacks can be overcome as evidenced by the research conducted by Druin et al. and Large et al., and that the notion of including children as full members of a design team merits further study. To better promote creativity, usability, and profitability, designers must move forward from the reactive process of including children towards the end of the design process in the limited roles of user and tester. Although not all V. Nesset, A. Large / Library & Information Science Research 26 (2004) 140\u2013161 159 children may be able to participate as full design partners, they can be involved as informants at salient points throughout the design process. And although participatory design techniques can often be expensive and time consuming when working with adults and are likely to be more so with children, the advantages in terms of innovation and appropriateness of design can outweigh these negative factors. As has been established in this review, researchers have demonstrated the benefits of including children in the design process. Therefore, to modify the quote by Scaife et al. (1997), in light of today\u2019s research into the development of children\u2019s technologies, it might now be said, \u2018\u2018the real issue would seem to be not whether involving children is good or bad but rather how to more effectively engage them in the design process.\" (159-160)",

Forty-eight undergraduate students participated in this study. The participants were divided into four groups according to cognitive style and online database search experience. Each participant searched for information on a university Web site to complete two differing search tasks. The time spent and the number of nodes visited in retrieving information were used to measure users' search performance. The choice of navigation tools was examined to determine users' search and navigational style. It was found that online search experience and cognitive style interacted and influenced search performance, as well as navigational style. Online search experience also interacted with task type to influence navigational style and the number of nodes visited. The article concludes with suggestions for improving Web interfaces and Web-user training programs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study of information literacy focuses on opinions, evidence, reviews, and data analysis from a sample of Spanish university students from three major fields of study (information/documentation, psychology, and translation/interpretation). The results have been tabulated from the subject area of documentation alone, as this subject is shared in the students' curricular planning. This study highlights students' attitudes, motivation, and evidence with regard to information literacy (IL) competencies. The standardized statistical model for evaluating latent traits was used to capture the structure of such capabilities. Data collection was performed using the IL-HUMASS (subjective) and the EVALCI-K (objective) questionnaires. The purpose is to achieve a better understanding of how \\IL\\ competencies\u2014approached from both objective and subjective perspectives, and grouped into the categories of searching, evaluation, processing, and communication/dissemination of information\u2014are interrelated. In this way, by combining objective (knowledge and skills) and subjective (belief-inimportance and self-efficacy) values with regard to \\IL\\ competencies, the processes of teaching and learning may be better understood and therefore better integrated within the curriculum framework. Patterns of correlation and/or causality between observed and latent competencies are explored.",

The concept of information source horizon was introduced, and it is a construct that enables one to put various information sources and channels in an order of preference to meet the requirements of information seeking. The horizon is based on one's conceptions of the characteristics of information sources, particularly their accessibility and quality. The study draws on interviews with eighteen Internet users who positioned various information sources in three zones of relevance. In their information source horizons, human sources such as friends and colleagues were preferred, followed by print media such as newspapers and books: networked sources were ranked third among six source types. Networked sources were favored for easy accessibility and opportunities to save time. The issue of \u201cfacilitating everyday life\u201d was emphasized in this context. Also currency, broad repertoire of networked information, and the potential of the Internet to complement other services were valued highly. Critical stands on the Internet were mainly affected by the negative experiences of encountering low quality material.",

        "abstract": "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the concept of book self-publishing for fiction and nonfiction began to loom large in the North American publishing universe. As traditional mainstream publishers consolidated and were often loathe to take chances on unknown writers whose books might not turn immediate profits, some authors found that fewer and fewer publishing venues were open to them. As a result, new self-publishers--collectively called \u00e4uthor services\" or print-on-demand (POD) publishers--appeared alongside subsidy (or vanity) publishers. Against the background of an increasing corporatization of mainstream publishing, book self-publishing can theoretically be situated as one of the last bastions of independent publishing. This article examines how academic and public libraries dealt with the book self-publishing phenomena during 1960-2004. To what extent did libraries collect fiction and nonfiction published by self-publishing houses? Can any patterns be discerned in their collecting choices? Did libraries choose to collect more titles from \u00e4uthor services\" publishers than subsidy publishers?",

Academic libraries need to support the mission of their university and therefore must also play their part in sustainability education and operations. The library and information science literature makes it appear that the hallmark of a \\textquotedblgreen library\\textquotedbl is an environmentally friendly building. There are very few academic libraries in the United States that are LEED certified. The author argues that a green library is something more than just the architecture. By using example initiatives and providing recommendations for green library operations, it can be determined that a green library does not necessarily entail a green building, but it does involve a green mission.

        "abstract": "Recruitment theory considers the relative importance of a range of factors (i.e., individuals, experiences, and other factors) in the decisions of those who select a profession, a professional specialty, and a specific employer. This study of the recruitment of bilingual librarians is based on a survey of the membership of REFORMA (The National Association to Promote Library Services to the Spanish Speaking). The data reflect the factors that influenced the career decision making of current library and information professionals who are, in the main, bilingual and Hispanic, as well as the factors influencing potential retention decisions. The research results indicate the importance of factors, such as entering a service profession and the desire to serve the Spanish-speaking community, in particular. As is the case with the prior (and limited) recruitment research in the profession, this article provides insights in terms of recruitment strategies for bilingual librarians who serve this segment of the population. While the research relates to a growing segment of the U.S. population, with its demographic complexity and range of information needs, implications, which are applicable to other language groups, bilingual circumstances, and other countries, are considered, as well.",

The archive's goal is to index the whole Web without making any judgments about which pages are worth saving. The potential importance of the archive for longitudinal and historical Web research leads to the need to evaluate its coverage. This article focuses upon whether there is an international bias in its coverage. The results show that there are indeed large national differences in the archive's coverage of the Web. A subsequent statistical analysis found differing national average site ages and hyperlink structures to be plausible explanations for this uneven coverage. Although the bias is unintentional, researchers using the archive in the future need to be aware of this problem.",

This method, which is an extension and refinement of citation analysis, was used to analyze the citation patterns of political scientists in relation to variations in their research approaches. Research articles in political science were operationally classified as to their analytic disposition into behavioral or traditional, and as to their method of research into quantitative or nonquantitative. Analysis of variance showed that differences in research approaches were a significant predictor for six of ten citation variables examined. Journal citation rate was higher for behavioralists than traditionalists. Behavioralists cited literature of greater median age than traditionalists, and the nonquantitative group cited a higher percentage of nonpolitical science subjects, had a higher journal citation rate, cited literature of a lower median age and cited more non-English literature",

Based on earlier findings regarding students' orientation toward processes and the degree of plagiarism exhibited, it analyses four cases in a new Australian study of Year 11 students. The two students who plagiarized least are compared with the two who plagiarized most in an ancient history assignment. Those who plagiarized most were less engaged with their topics; remembered less about them a month later; demonstrated less interest in processes such as learning, seeking meaning, or understanding; and were less able to recognize plagiarism than did those who plagiarized least. Those who plagiarized least incorporated direct quotations more effectively, used fewer quotations, and synthesized information and ideas better than did the others. Learning experiences that emphasize student engagement and construction of knowledge through appropriate and effective information use should t",

The survey is the first phase of a study exploring the actual and potential role of Canadian public libraries in developing the public's IL skills. Despite an urgent need to develop such skills, and expectations that public libraries fulfill that role (specifically articulated by the federal government through its \u201cConnecting Canadians\u201d initiative), the real experiences of public librarians and of public library customers may not bear out this expectation. The survey analyzes the role of the public library, as a non-profit institution and primary stakeholder, in advancing federal government information policy. In addition, the study gives voice to a community of professionals expected to fulfill an important federal policy function, but provided with few resources with which to do so",

The case study reported here explored bilingual user behaviors, perceptions, and preferences with respect to the capability of the Web as a multilingual information resource. Twenty-eight bilingual academic users from Myongji University in Korea were recruited for the study. Findings show that the subjects did not use Web search engines as multilingual tools. For search queries, they selected a language that represents their information need most accurately depending on the types of information task rather than choosing their first language. Subjects expressed concerns about the accuracy of machine translation of scholarly terminologies and preferred to have user control over multilingual Web searches.",

The first level consists of three chapters each examining particular perspectives of the relationship. First, in terms of an examination of how communication technologies have shaped forms of social organization, I argue how knowledge organization is constituted by social organization. Second, I further situate knowledge organization in light of J\u00fcrgen Habermas' theory of the public sphere and argue that this theory can be viewed as a fundamental model of knowledge organization. Third, by drawing on various theories of genre and activity systems, I underpin the connection between social organization and knowledge organization further by seeking to integrate these with knowledge organization. The second level examines the role of knowledge organization in scholarly communication by means of how indexing reflects and responds to the rhetorical activities of scholarly articles. I consider this as how knowledge organization can ascribe cognitive authority to documents. The texts are considered to constitute the mediating link between social organization and knowledge organization. I conclude that this relationship between social organization and knowledge organization must be understood and examined in order to fully account for the role knowledge organization in human activities based on document production and use such as scholarly communication.",

Although FRBR offers great potential for libraries to develop catalogs that function more effectively to help users access bibliographic data, there has been a lack of both guidance in FRBR implementation and FRBR user research in related development. In this session, panelists presenting three different projects will discuss how they implemented FRBR in library catalogs and what user research they have done to inform system design and to evaluate the effectiveness of the FRBR systems. This panel will help address some key questions about FRBR research and development: (1) To what extent does the FRBR model represent how users perceive bibliographic data? (2) How can FRBR be implemented in library catalogs? (3) How are FRBR-based systems helpful to users?",

        "abstract": "The sustainable development in librarianship is relatively a new research field. This paper aims to increase readers' understanding of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS) in terms of complexity and diversity. A detailed plan was drawn up from Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) to achieve the objectives of this study. An inclusion and exclusion criteria was established and each study item passed through identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion before being placed in the final pool of items. This paper reviewed literature chosen from LISA, LISTA, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases spanning from 2000 to 2020. Findings revealed that there was diverse type of sustainable development challenges in Library and Information Science (LIS). Absence of sustainable strategies, lack of sustainable education in the LIS curriculum, operations, services and buildings designs and massive energy consumption due to long service hours of libraries were major challenges. More importantly, the rapid digital and technological advances have made libraries' current equipment irrelevant casting a large carbon footprint on the globe. Challenges to adaptation are compounded by clinging to old traditions and resistance to change which limit the ability to plan for long term sustainable development (SD) goals. There is need to remove these obstacles to accrue benefits for today and far reaching implications for the future. The study provides an integrative report to help library leaders and educational policy makers in Pakistan to apply SD initiatives more effectively according to the institutes' contextual needs. The results of this study will also help further the sustainability agenda in LIS by incorporating sustainability into the LIS curriculum.",

        "abstract": "This study is designed to validate 10 Power Distance indicators identified from previous research on cultural dimensions to establish a measurement for determining a country's national political freedom represented on Web content and interface design. Two coders performed content analysis on 156 college/university Web sites selected from 39 countries. One-way analysis of variance was applied to analyze each of the proposed 10 indicators to detect statistical significant differences among means of the three freedom groups (free-country group, partly-free-country group, and not-free-country group). The results indicated that 6 of the 10 proposed indicators could be used to measure a country's national political freedom on Web interface design. The seventh indicator, symmetric layout, demonstrated a negative correlation between the freedom level and the Web representation of Power Distance. The last three proposed indicators failed to show any significant differences among the treatment means, and there are no clear trend patterns for the treatment means of the three freedom groups. By examining national political freedom represented on Web pages, this study not only provides an insight into cultural dimensions and Web interface design but also advances our knowledge in sociological and cultural studies of the Web.",

The recent history of LIS and the practice of professional library work are examined for evidence of the basis for making claims about LIS.

The study is undertaken by use of literature review and interviews with a purposive select sample of public library users in Denmark. The study demonstrates that public libraries are considered an important place for learning. The high school students view the public librarians as very competent and as good at helping them to develop their information needs, identify sources, and support the students in the information search processes. The high school students show rather good critical skills, but poor information need developing skills. The study further shows that concepts of information literacy and lifelong learning are not very well understood by the users, i.e. the high school students. The results have a range of implications, both for pedagogical praxis in the public library and for Library and Information Science (LIS).",

Adaptive reuse benefits the environment by conserving natural resources and minimizing the need for new materials. This chapter provides a review of some key documents on sustainability, green libraries and the recycling and conversion of buildings as libraries. Building reuse provides an opportunity for sustainable thinking in library planning. Sustainability and going green are already evident in library architecture and design and there is a need to encourage embracing greener practices and adaptive reuse. Sustainability and going green are growth areas for the future. Adaptive reuse and repurposing buildings that have outlived their original purposes for different uses or functions while at the same time retaining their historic features are viable alternatives to new buildings. Building reuse is occurring in developed countries while some developing countries are saddled with challenges slowing adoption of the trend.",

Science & Technology Libraries, 34(3), 272-286. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0194262X.2015.1090941 Objective \u2013 To investigate the engineering faculty's information-seeking behaviour, experiences, awareness, and use of the university library. Design \u2013 Web-based survey questionnaire. Setting \u2013 The main campus of a state university in the United States of America. Subjects \u2013 119 faculty members within 8 engineering departments. Methods \u2013 An email invitation to participate in a 16-item electronic survey questionnaire, with questions related to library use, was sent in the spring of 2015 to 119 engineering faculty members. Faculty were given 24 days to complete the survey, and a reminder email was sent 10 days after the original survey invitation. Main Results \u2013 Thirty-eight faculty members responded to the survey, representing a response rate of 32\\%. Overall, faculty had a high level of use and awareness of both online and physical library resources and services, although their awareness of certain scholarly communication services, such as data archiving and copyright advisory, was significantly lower. Faculty tend to turn to Google and Google Scholar when searching for information rather than turning to library databases. Faculty do not use social media to keep up with library news and updates. The library website, as well as liaison librarians, were cited as the primary sources for this type of information. Conclusions \u2013 The researcher concludes that librarians need to do a better job of marketing library resources, such as discipline-specific databases, as well as other library search tools. Because faculty use web search engines as a significant source of information, the author proposes further research on this behaviour, and suggests more action to educate faculty on different search tools, their limitations, and effective use. As faculty indicated a general lack of interest in integrating information literacy into their classes, the researcher notes that librarians need to find ways to persuade faculty that this type of integrated instruction is beneficial for students' learning and research needs. Faculty were aware of the library liaison program, so this baseline relationship between faculty and librarian can serve as an opportunity to build upon current liaison services and responsibilities.\\textless/p\\textgreater",

However, the subject has gained prominence in recent years and discussions surrounding the role and social responsibilities of library science concerning this issue are increasing. Germany is one of the most sustainable countries in the world, and its libraries have become an international example of sustainability. This research aims to answer the following questions: A) Do librarians in Germany know what the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are? B) Do the German libraries have any partnership with another institution to carry out projects/ programs (supporting/ funding agencies, Friends of the Library, etc.)? C) Which SDGs are German public libraries addressing? Which SDGs are most pursued?",

By exploiting this phase-locking, we have sped up or slowed down the orbital motion of the electron in excited lithium atoms by increa sing or decreasing the microwave frequency between 13 and 19 gigahertz; the binding energy and orbital size change concurrently.",

Library services for incarcerated persons: A survey of recent trends and challenges in prison libraries in Croatia. Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 48(1), 72-89. http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0961000614538481 \n\nObjective \u2013 To compare the status of prison libraries in Croatia to prior studies and ultimately, to guidelines for prison library services (Lehmann & Locke, 2005). Two research questions were asked: 1) How are Croatian prison libraries organized and managed? and 2) What kind of library collections and services are offered to incarcerated persons in Croatia?\n\nDesign \u2013 Quantitative survey. \n\nSetting \u2013 23 Croatian prison libraries.\n\nSubjects \u2013 Persons in charge of prison libraries.\n\nMethods \u2013 A paper survey was mailed to all 23 Croatian prisons in 2013. The survey consisted of 31 questions grouped into 3 categories: general library information, management of the library, and use. Analysis provided descriptive statistics.\n\nMain Results \u2013 Twenty-one responses (91\\%) were received. For the 10 institutions providing data on library holdings size, the numbers ranged from 450 to 6122, but per capita figures were not possible to calculate as no responses provided prison population size. Most (65\\%) maintained an entry book for new acquisitions, while one library kept a card catalogue. Half performed collection assessment on an annual basis.\n\nWhile all but 1 of the prisons had libraries, most (16 of 20) reported that funding was not provided on a regular basis; 13 had space allocated specifically for library purposes, but none were staffed by trained librarians, instead using prison staff or prisoners. Only two libraries practised regularly-scheduled collection development, with half acquiring materials solely through donations resulting in limited topical coverage. All collections included monographs, but only around 25\\% carried newspapers, magazines, music, or videos. While use of the libraries was high, most responses reflected severely limited educational, rehabilitative or cultural programming and access to the internet, and lack of space for collections and reading purposes.\n\nConclusion \u2013 Libraries in Croatia fail to meet international standards for staffing, collections, and services. Recommendations for immediate improvement are made, including legislative advocacy and funding, improved public library involvement, and the creation of national standards aligned with international standards.",

        "abstract": "The Florida State University (FSU) College of Medicine Medical Library is the first academic medical library to be established since the Web's dramatic appearance during the 1990s. A large customer base for electronic medical information resources is both comfortable with and eager to migrate to the electronic format completely, and vendors are designing radical pricing models that make print journal cancellations economically advantageous. In this (almost) post-print environment, the new FSU Medical Library is being created and will continue to evolve. By analyzing print journal subscription lists of eighteen academic medical libraries with similar missions to the community-based FSU College of Medicine and by entering these and selected quality indicators into a Microsoft Access database, a core list was created. This list serves as a selection guide, as a point for discussion with faculty and curriculum leaders when creating budgets, and for financial negotiations in a broader university environment. After journal titles specific to allied health sciences, veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, library science, and nursing were eliminated from the list, 4,225 unique journal titles emerged. Based on a ten-point scale including SERHOLD holdings and DOCLINE borrowing activity, a list of 449 core titles is identified. The core list has been saved in spreadsheet format for easy sorting by a number of parameters.",

The use of references in the humanities is discussed in connection with the growing interest in the possibilities of applying citation analysis to humanistic disciplines. The study shows how the use of references within the humanities is connected to concepts of originality, to intellectual organization, and to searching and writing. Finally, it is acknowledged that the use of references is connected to stylistic, epistemological, and organizational differences, and these differences must be taken into account when applying citation analysis to humanistic disciplines.",

In this regard true native perspective is needed to be adopted for bibliographic classification in digital environments. In this research article, we have investigated and reported different approaches to bibliographic classification of digital collections. The article also contributes two evaluation frameworks that evaluate different classification schemes and elaborate different approaches that exist in theory, in manual practice and automatically in digital environments.

        "abstract": "This book shows you how to harness the power of linked data and web-scale discovery systems to manage and link widely varied content across your library collection. Libraries are increasingly using web-scale discovery systems to help clients find a wide assortment of library materials, including books, journal articles, special collections, archival collections, videos, music and open access collections. Depending on the library material catalogued, the discovery system might need to negotiate different metadata standards, such as AACR, RDA, RAD, FOAF, VRA Core, METS, MODS, RDF and more. In Managing Metadata in Web-Scale Discovery Systems, editor Louise Spiteri and a range of international experts show you how to:  * maximize the effectiveness of web-scale discovery systems * provide a smooth and seamless discovery experience to your users * help users conduct searches that yield relevant results * manage the sheer volume of items to which you can provide access, so your users can actually find what they need * maintain shared records that reflect the needs, languages, and identities of culturally and ethnically varied communities * manage metadata both within, across, and outside, library discovery tools by converting your library metadata to linked open data that all systems can access * manage user generated metadata from external services such as Goodreads and LibraryThing  * mine user generated metadata to better serve your users in areas such as collection development or readers' advisory. The book will be essential reading for cataloguers, technical services and systems librarians and library and information science students studying modules on metadata, cataloguing, systems design, data management, and digital libraries. The book will also be of interest to those managing metadata in archives, museums and other cultural heritage institutions.",

To those active within the OA arena, the case has been convincingly made, and current arguments merely need to be disseminated beyond the Library and Information Science (LIS) sphere. However, it is my contention that a convincing argument for OA sc needs to be launched from the Science Policy perspective if any government mandated pro-OA policy changes are to be effected. This paper, then, is an attempt at taking the OA discussion beyond the LIS arena and into the realm of Science and Innovation Policy. Using Innovation Theory as its theoretical framework, it is argued that Open Access scholarly communication can only serve to bolster Innovation Systems, be they national, regional, or sectoral. The case of South Africa is taken as an illustrative example, though the case can and will be generalised to beyond the South African science system. Making the case for OA within the context of Innovation is also of strategic import, since government policymakers frequently heed the advice of Science- and Innovation Policy researchers.",

        "abstract": "Background. In most academic disciplines journals play an important role in disseminating findings of research among the disciplinary community members. Understanding a discipline's body of journals is therefore of grave importance when looking for previous research, compiling an overview of previous research and and in order to make a decision regarding the best place for publishing research results. Furthermore, based on Bradford's Law of scattering, one can assume that in order to be able to compile a satisfying overview of previous research a wide range of journals has to be scanned, but also that there are some 'core' journals which are of more importance to specific disciplines than others. Aim. This thesis aims to compile a comprehensive master list of journals which publish articles of relevance to Library and Information Science (LIS). A method to rank journals by their importance is introduced and some key characteristics of the disciplines body of journals are discussed. Databases indexing the disciplines journals are also compared. Method. The master list of LIS journals was created by combining the journal listings of secondary sources indexing the field's literature. These sources were six databases focusing on LIS literature: INFODATA, Current Contents, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library Information Science Technology Abstracts, Information Science and Technology Abstracts, and Library Literature and Information Science, the LIS subsection in three databases with a general focus: Social Science Citation Index, Academic Search Premier, and Expanded Academic ASAP, and the listing of LIS journals from the Elektronische Zeitschriften Bibliothek. Problems related to editorial policies and technical shortcomings are discussed, before comparing: predominant publication languages, places of publication, open access, peer review, and the ISI Journal Impact Factors (JIF). Journals were also ranked by the number of occurrences in multiple databases in order to identify 'core' publications. The number of journals overlapping between databases are estimated and a matrix giving the overlap is visualized using multi dimensional scaling. Lastly, the degree of journals overlapping with other disciplines is measured. Results. A comprehensive master list of 1,205 journals publishing articles of relevance to LIS was compiled. The 968 active journals are mostly published in English, with one third of the journals coming from the US and another third from the UK and Germany. Nearly 16% of all journals are open access, 11% have a ISIJIF, and 42% are peer reviewed. Fifteen core journal could be identified and a list of the top fourteen journals published in Germany is introduced. Databases have between five to 318 journals in common and the journal collection shows an substantial overlap with a wide range of subjects, with the biggest journal overlap with Computing Studies, and Business and Economics. Conclusion. The aim of compiling a comprehensive list of LIS journal was achieved. The list will contribute to our understanding of scholarly communication within the LIS discipline and provide academics and practitioners with a better understanding of journals within the discipline. The ranking approach proved to be sufficient, showing good similarity with other studies over the last 40 years. The master list of LIS journals has also potential use to further research.",

This study seeks to better understand aggregates through the analysis of a sample of bibliographic records and review of the cataloging treatment of aggregates. The study focuses on determining how common aggregates are in library collections, what types of aggregates exist, how aggregates are described in bibliographic records, and the criteria for identifying aggregates from the information in bibliographic records. A sample of bibliographic records representing textual resources was taken from OCLC\u2019s WorldCat database. More than 20 percent of the sampled records represented aggregates and more works were embodied in aggregates than were embodied in single work manifestations. A variety of issues, including cataloging practices and the varying definitions of aggregates, made it difficult to accurately identify and quantify the presence of aggregates using only the information from bibliographic records.",

It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types.RESULTS:The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here.CONCLUSIONS:Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in terms of speed, read length, and throughput, along with a sharp reduction in per-base cost. Together, these advances democratized NGS and paved the way for the development of a large number of novel NGS applications in basic science as well as in translational research areas such as clinical diagnostics, agrigenomics, and forensic science. Here we provide an overview of the evolution of NGS and discuss the most significant improvements in sequencing technologies and library preparation protocols. We also explore the current landscape of NGS applications and provide a perspective for future developments. Copyright \\copyright 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Context is one of the key concepts in library and information science research. This paper provides a conceptual overview of the use of the notion of usefulness in library and information science literature, explicates its relation to key parallel concepts, and on the basis of an empirical vignette in the context of health information research, discusses the potential limits and advantages of referring to usefulness instead of and together with other related concepts. The paper is based on conceptual discussion and a selective review of literature. This paper explicates the implications of the traditional approach of conceptualising context in information research as bounded sets or \u2019quasi-bounded-sets\u2019, and to contrast an alternative view of treating them as centred sets or processes. Instead of seeing context as a single- or multi-layered surrounding, describing it as a centred set makes it a position with affinities to different factors, situations, people or things. Even if all of the approaches have their inherent limitations, the notion of centred set provides means to rethink context and to help to avoid the temptation to treat it as an unspecified container and make it possible to explicate its constituents and their movement toward or from its nucleus.",

Big science  fields such as physics and astronomy that collaborate around expensive instrumentation have constructed shared digital libraries to manage their data and documents, while  little science  research areas that gather data through hand-crafted fieldwork continue to manage their data locally. As habitat ecology researchers begin to deploy embedded sensor networks, they are confronting an array of challenges in capturing, organizing, and managing large amounts of data. The scientists and their partners in computer science and engineering make use of common datasets but interpret the data differently. Studies of this field in transition offer insights into the role of digital libraries in e-Science, how data practices evolve as science becomes more instrumented, and how scientists, computer scientists, and engineers collaborate around data. Among the lessons learned are that data on the same variables are gathered by multiple means, that data exist in many states and in many places, and that publication practices often drive data collection practices. Data sharing is embraced in principle but little sharing actually occurs, due to interrelated factors such as lack of demand, lack of standards, and concerns about publication, ownership, data quality, and ethics. We explore the implications of these findings for data policy and digital library architecture. Research reported here is affiliated with the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing.",

Design/methodology/approach Revision of a keynote address at the BOCATSSS2020 conference, this paper offers an overview of current literature comparing it with a moment in the past that was crucial for information: post-Second World War time, when Wiener (1948) founded cybernetics and C.P. Snow advocated for \u201cThe two cultures\u201d (1959). Findings The complex issue demands a multi-disciplinary approach: there is not one solution, and some approaches risk limiting the freedom of expression, yet countering the phenomenon is a moral obligation for library and information science professionals. Originality/value Comparing the present digital revolution with the past, this paper opens questions on the ethical commitment of information professionals.",

It takes a fair degree of information savvy to create, represent and supply information as well as to search for and retrieve relevant knowledge. How does information (documents, pieces of knowledge) have to be organized in order to be retrievable? What role does metadata play? What are search engines on the Web, or in corporate intranets, and how do they work? How must one deal with natural language processing and tools of knowledge organization, such as thesauri, classification systems, and ontologies? How useful is social tagging? How valuable are intellectually created abstracts and automatically prepared extracts? Which empirical methods allow for user research and which for the evaluation of information systems? This Handbook is a basic work of information science, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of information retrieval and knowledge representation. It addresses readers from all professions and scientific disciplines, but particularly scholars, practitioners and students of Information Science, Library Science, Computer Science, Information Management, and Knowledge Management. This Handbook is a suitable reference work for Public and Academic Libraries.",

        "abstract": "The response of cells to changes in their physico-chemical\r\n   micro-environment is essential to their survival. For example, bacterial\r\n   magnetotaxis uses the Earth's magnetic field together with chemical\r\n   sensing to help microorganisms move towards favoured habitats. The\r\n   studies of such complex responses are lacking a method that permits the\r\n   simultaneous mapping of the chemical environment and the response of the\r\n   organisms, and the ability to generate a controlled physiological\r\n   magnetic field. We have thus developed a multi-modal microscopy platform\r\n   that fulfils these requirements. Using simultaneous fluorescence and\r\n   high-speed imaging in conjunction with diffusion and aerotactic models,\r\n   we characterized the magneto-aerotaxis of Magnetospirillum gryph is\r\n   waldense. We assessed the influence of the magnetic field (orientation;\r\n   strength) on the formation and the dynamic of a micro-aerotactic band\r\n   (size, dynamic, position). As previously described by models of\r\n   magnetotaxis, the application of a magnetic field pointing towards the\r\n   anoxic zone of an oxygen gradient results in an enhanced aerotaxis even\r\n   down to Earth's magnetic field strength. We found that neither a\r\n   ten-fold increase of the field strength nor a tilt of 45 degrees\r\n   resulted in a significant change of the aerotactic efficiency. However,\r\n   when the field strength is zeroed or when the field angle is tilted to\r\n   90 degrees, the magneto-aerotaxis efficiency is drastically reduced. The\r\n   classical model of magneto-aerotaxis assumes a response proportional to\r\n   the cosine of the angle difference between the directions of the oxygen\r\n   gradient and that of the magnetic field. Our experimental evidence\r\n   however shows that this behaviour is more complex than assumed in this\r\n   model, thus opening up new avenues for research.",

Here, loop-closure in poly-glycine-serine peptides is investigated by combining single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulation. For chains containing more than 10 peptide bonds loop-closing rate constants on the 20-100 nanosecond time range exhibit a power-law length dependence. However, this scaling breaks down for shorter peptides, which exhibit slower kinetics arising from a perturbation induced by the dye reporter system used in the experimental setup. The loop-closure kinetics in the longer peptides is found to be determined by the formation of intra-peptide hydrogen bonds and transient beta-sheet structure, that accelerate the search for contacts among residues distant in sequence relative to the case of a polypeptide chain in which hydrogen bonds cannot form. Hydrogen-bond-driven polypeptide-chain collapse in unfolded peptides under physiological conditions found here is not only consistent with hierarchical models of protein folding, that highlights the importance of secondary structure formation early in the folding process, but is also shown to speed up the search for productive folding events.",

Based on a brief review of articles discussing how to predict JIFs and taking data differences between the Web of Science (WoS) and the JCR into account, we make our own predictions. Using data by cited-reference searching for Thomson Scientific^a\u20ac\u2122s WoS, we predict 2007 impact factors (IFs) for several journals, such as Nature, Science, Learned Publishing and some Library and Information Sciences journals. Based on our colleagues^a\u20ac\u2122 experiences we expect our predictions to be lower bounds for the official journal impact factors. We explain why it is useful to derive one^a\u20ac\u2122s own journal impact factor.",

Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that makes it easy to build intuitive workflows for ingesting and analyzing large, distributed datasets. Dask provides dynamic task scheduling and parallel collections that extend the functionality of NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, enabling users to scale their code from a single laptop to a cluster of hundreds of machines with ease. \"Data science with Python and Dask\" teaches you to build scalable projects that can handle massive datasets. After meeting the Dask framework, you'll analyze data in the nYC Parking Ticket database and use DataFrames to streamline your process. Then, you'll create machine learning models using Dask-ML, build interactive visualizations, and build clusters using AWS and Docker.",

Later, she and her colleagues developed a data-gathering method based on information horizons theory and user-drawn information horizon maps. The method provides a good basis for in-depth discussions and complements interviewing as a way to gather data. Based on interview records of Finnish and Swedish archaeology professionals, researchers drew diagrams called&nbsp;<i>analytical information horizon maps</i>&nbsp;with the purpose of structuring, describing and analyzing typical information behaviors related to the work roles of the interviewed individuals. The findings indicate that the analytical information horizon maps provide a practicable and qualitatively valid means to visualize, communicate, and structure individual and shared patterns of use of the information resources and the organization of information activity.</span></p>",

Moreover, this research finds that articles in\r\n   high-ranked journals do not have a higher open access rate, and articles\r\n   in lower-ranked journals have a greater increase rate of citations if\r\n   they are freely accessible.\r\n   Originality/value - The findings are contrary to the existing theory\r\n   that a higher citation rate of open access articles is caused by authors\r\n   posting their best articles online. It is hoped that the research\r\n   discoveries can help electronic publishers and digital project managers\r\n   to adjust their strategies in open access advocacy.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of social behaviors early in life is likely crucial\r\n\tfor the development of mother-infant relationships. Some of these\r\n\tbehaviors, such as the capacity of neonates to imitate adult facial\r\n\tmovements, were previously thought to be limited to humans and perhaps\r\n\tthe ape lineage. Here we report the behavioral responses of infant\r\n\trhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to the following human facial and\r\n\thand gestures: lip smacking, tongue protrusion, mouth opening, hand\r\n\topening, and opening and closing of eyes (control condition). In\r\n\tthe third day of life, infant macaques imitate lip smacking and tongue\r\n\tprotrusion. On the first day of life, the model's mouth openings\r\n\telicited a similar matched behavior (lip smacking) in the infants.\r\n\tThese imitative responses are present at an early stage of development,\r\n\tbut they are apparently confined to a narrow temporal window. Because\r\n\tlip smacking is a core gesture in face-to-face interactions in macaques,\r\n\tneonatal imitation may serve to tune infants' affiliative responses\r\n\tto the social world. Our findings provide a quantitative description\r\n\tof neonatal imitation in a nonhuman primate species and suggest that\r\n\tthese imitative capacities, contrary to what was previously thought,\r\n\tare not unique to the ape and human lineage. We suggest that their\r\n\tevolutionary origins may be traced to affiliative gestures with communicative\r\n\tfunctions.",

A qualitative, interpretivist approach is adopted, involving 34 students, ages 18 to 25, from an Australian university. First, 20 students were interviewed about their news seeking (including topics and sources). Then 14 students participated in verbal protocol analysis, which involved a series of tasks concerning online and print newspapers. Lastly, students were interviewed about how they sought everyday-life information and whether they thought that they had incidentally acquired or encountered information on everyday-life topics in online or print newspapers in the recent past. Findings indicated that, contrary to expectations, traditional print media still played a role for young people, and social media were perceived as important for communication with friends, rather than for news gathering. Purposeful information seeking was more likely to occur online, but both print and online newspapers retained an incidental role in providing information to students for their everyday lives. Participants used a range of media to suit their particular needs and purposes. Thus, access to a wide variety of sources is important for everyday-life information seeking (ELIS) by young people.",

The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or \u00e4ltmetrics\", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science. We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5\\% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80\\% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact \"flavors\", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble, the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) Pathways project for Computing, builds upon a diverse group of prior NSDL, DL-I, and other projects. Ensemble has shaped its activities according to principles related to design, development, implementation, and operation of distributed portals. Here we articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (PDPs). While our focus is on education and pedagogy, we expect that our experiences will generalize to other digital library application domains. These principles inform, facilitate, and enhance the Ensemble R&\\#38;D and production activities. They allow us to provide a broad range of services, from personalization to coordination across communities. The eight PDPs can be briefly summarized as: (1) Articulation across communities using ontologies. (2) Browsing tailored to collections. (3) Integration across interfaces and virtual environments. (4) Metadata interoperability and integration. (5) Social graph construction using logging and metrics. (6) Superimposed information and annotation integrated across distributed systems. (7) Streamlined user access with IDs. (8) Web 2.0 multiple social network system interconnection.",

The article identifies books that could be read in graduate-level courses on information history that are taught either chronologically or thematically. It also identifies historical questions that cut across the six subdisciplines.",

Ironically, these have occurred at the same time that increasingly stringent copyright laws have restricted access to cultural content. Concepts of governmentality are used here to examine these tensions and contradictions. In particular, Foucault\u2019s critique of the author figure and freedom as part of the will to govern within liberal democratic societies is used to argue for better quality copyright education programs in school libraries and library information science education programs. For purposes of teaching and research, copyrights are defined as agglomerations of legal, economic, and educational discourses that enable and constrain what can and cannot be done with text in homes, schools, and library media centers. This article presents some possibilities for renewal of school libraries around copyright education and Creative Commons licensing.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble, the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) Pathways project for Computing, builds upon a diverse group of prior NSDL, DL-I, and other projects. Ensemble has shaped its activities according to principles related to design, development, implementation, and operation of distributed portals. Here we articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (PDPs). While our focus is on education and pedagogy, we expect that our experiences will generalize to other digital library application domains. These principles inform, facilitate, and enhance the Ensemble R&\\#38;D and production activities. They allow us to provide a broad range of services, from personalization to coordination across communities. The eight PDPs can be briefly summarized as: (1) Articulation across communities using ontologies. (2) Browsing tailored to collections. (3) Integration across interfaces and virtual environments. (4) Metadata interoperability and integration. (5) Social graph construction using logging and metrics. (6) Superimposed information and annotation integrated across distributed systems. (7) Streamlined user access with IDs. (8) Web 2.0 multiple social network system interconnection.",

        "abstract": "In the field of records and information management (RIM), classification is central for categorizing information including those embedded in records into a systematic structure for controlling and retrieval purposes. It is particularly a paramount concept and activity for information-related organization to organize and manage information from the beginning of its creation to disposal. The evolution of classification has diversified in applications in regards with the discipline of study including archival, library and information science. The need of classification has becoming more urgent in technology environment where information is easily created. However, technology has caused the authenticity and the integrity of information can be easily tampered and challenged. Technology together with the absence of classification has caused problems in dealing with information particularly in the aspect of storage. When classification is under-explored and minimally understood albeit its importance, the management of digital information becomes risky thus, affect to obscure decision making and provocation by laws. Therefore, it is essential that the concept is explored and be applied to ensure information/digital information created, maintained and preserved are in context, trustworthy, authentic and conform to standards and regulations. This paper discusses the concept of classification from various field so as to make clear why classification is significant to the records management field although is more popular in library science.",

        "abstract": "Summary: This paper examines the extent to which the South African Library and Information Science (LIS) agenda maps to the national agenda for the reconstruction and development of the country, which is geared to the elimination of poverty and inequality. The nation has been described as comprising two societies: the one modern and well developed, the other characterised by masses of people living in dire poverty. The mandate of LIS in South Africa includes supporting and stimulating the technological and information development of all communities and providing effective LIS education to meet this goal. The government has embraced the concept of the Information Society, emphasising the link between economic growth and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and has pointed to the need for information literacy education. We present a critique of the fit between LIS policies and practices (including the curriculum) and the needs of an emerging democracy and its development goals, challenged by the duality of globalisation and marginalisation.

        "abstract": "This paper deals with two document-document similarity approaches in the context of science mapping: bibliographic coupling and a text approach based on the number of common abstract stems. We used 43 articles, published in the journal Information Retrieval, as test articles. An information retrieval expert performed a classification of these articles. We used the cosine measure for normalization, and the complete linkage method was used for clustering the articles. A number of articles pairs were ranked (1) according to descending normalized coupling strength, and (2) according to descending normalized frequency of common abstract stems. The degree of agreement between the two obtained rankings was low, as measured by Kendall\u2019s tau. The agreement between the two cluster solutions, one for each approach, was fairly low, according to the adjusted Rand index. However, there were examples of perfect agreement between the coupling solution and the stems solution. The classification generated by the expert contained larger groups compared to the coupling and stems solutions, and the agreement between the two solutions and the classification was not high. According to the adjusted Rand index, though, the stems solution was a better approximation of the classification than the coupling solution. With respect to cluster quality, the overall Silhouette value was slightly higher for the stems solution. Examples of homogeneous cluster structures, as well as negative Silhouette values, were found with regard to both solutions. The expert classification indicates that the field of information retrieval, as represented by one volume of articles published in Information Retrieval, is fairly heterogeneous regarding research themes, since the classification is associated with 15 themes. The complete linkage method, in combination with the upper tail rule, gave rise to a fairly good approximation of the classification with respect to the number of identified groups, especially in case of the stems approach.",

The share of female contributors to these journals has certainly increased during the studied period, 1980\u20132000. However, the results of the quantitative citation analysis show puzzling differences concerning female and male authors\u2019 citation practice. There may be a gender bias in LIS publishing, even though female authors have become more numerous. Further studies are needed to uncover the influence of other variables, such as subject content of the articles.",

        "abstract": "The emerging user-centric model of relevance proposes that the only valid measure of relevance of a document to a user's information need is the one made by that user. If we accept this proposition, it raises an interesting question: how well do other people, especially those involved in information work who make such judgments as part of their training and work, perform as judges of documents for information needs they did not originate? This question was empirically tested, using three groups of subjects: incoming students to a school of information/library science, continuing students in that school, and academic librarians (holders of the MLS degree). These subjects made judgments of either relevance, utility, or topicality of two document sets to the original users' stated information need. These judgments were then compared to those of the users to see what patterns emerged, and to see what can be learned not only about secondary judgments in general, but also the ways in which information and library professionals make such judgments. These results are interesting in their own right (subject's judgments compared reasonably well to those of users, looked more like users' after more training and experience in library work, and fall into interesting patterns), but they also lead to some provocative questions about the nature of judgment and evaluation of information items. \u00a9 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new theory of metadata enriching and filtering. The theory emerged from a rigorous grounded theory data analysis of 57 in-depth interviews with metadata experts, library and information science researchers, librarians as well as academic library users (G. Alemu, A Theory of Digital Library Metadata: The Emergence of Enriching and Filtering, University of Portsmouth PhD thesis, Portsmouth, 2014). Partly due to the novelty of Web 2.0 approaches and mainly due to the absence of foundational theories to underpin socially constructed metadata approaches, this research adapted a social constructivist philosophical approach and a constructivist grounded theory method (K. Charmaz, Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis, SAGE Publications, London, 2006). The theory espouses the importance of enriching information objects with descriptions pertaining to the about-ness of information objects. Such richness and diversity of descriptions, it is argued, could chiefly be achieved by involving users in the metadata creation process. The theory includes four overarching metadata principles \u2013 metadata enriching, linking, openness and filtering. The theory proposes a mixed metadata approach where metadata experts provide the requisite basic descriptive metadata, structure and interoperability (a priori metadata) while users continually enrich it with their own interpretations (post-hoc metadata). Enriched metadata is inter- and cross-linked (the principle of linking), made openly accessible (the principle of openness) and presented (the principle of filtering) according to user needs.",

They are schematic prelinguistic conceptualisations of events and serve as conceptual building blocks for concepts. This paper proposes that image schemas can play an important role in computational concept invention, namely within the computational realisation of conceptual blending. We propose to build a library of formalised image schemas, and illustrate how they can guide the search for a base space in the concept invention work flow. Their schematic nature is captured by the idea of organising image schemas into families. Formally, they are represented as heterogeneous, interlinked theories.",

Further reproduction of this article in violation of the copyright is prohibited. To contact the publisher: http://www.ala.org/ Walt Crawford In preparing to speak at the 30th anniversary of the University of Tennessee's School of Information Science last fall, I looked at some elements of library life in 1972 and 1973. How many people remember what library services and technology were like three decades ago? I worked at the University of California at Berkeley's Doe Library in 1973, having designed and implemented the punch-card circulation system that was Doe's first library automation. We had a visit from the FBI very early in the 1970s and learned to destroy circulation records as soon as items were returned. How's your 2003 privacy audit going? Can you assure readers that their circulation histories are private? You haven't done a privacy audit? You should. YOUR LIBRARY IN 1972-73 You almost certainly had a card catalog. MARC II existed, but shared online cataloging was in its infancy--OCLC went online in 1971, but primarily served a few dozen Ohio institutions by 1973. BALLOTS, the underlying software for RLG's RLIN, went online in November 1972--but RLG didn't exist until 1975. WLN began offering services in late 1972, but didn't go online until 1975 or later. You might have had a circulation system using a \"minicomputer\" that you'd consider huge by today's standards, but with a fraction of the power of today's cheapest PCs. It's possible that you searched remote databases on SDC or BRS with a state-of-the-art 300-bps modem, or, in a university library, searched locally mounted databases through batch processing. Library automation began considerably earlier. The Information Science and Automation Division, the earlier name of ALA's Library and Information Technology Association, began in 1966. Microprocessors already existed (Intel's 8088 came out in late 1972, the 8080 in 1973), but personal computers didn't appear until 1975; the first widely used models (Commodore PET, Apple II, Radio Shack TRS-80) showed up in 1977. The first IBM PC was still eight years away--and that PC didn't have any hard disk. The books on your shelves didn't have ISBNs, although a few of them might have had SBNs, the predecessor standard adopted in 1973. If you circulated movies at all, they were films, probably 16mm reels. You might have had some U-Matic videocassettes (introduced in 1971), but Betamax and VHS came along in 1975 and 1976. 1973 was a banner year for hard disks, but they were too big, slow, and expensive for most library use. The first modern hard disk, IBM's 3340 \"Winchester,\" appeared that year--a 14-inch, 80-pound beast costing thousands of dollars and holding 35 to 70 megabytes. It was attached to room-filling mainframe computers. The first PC hard disk appeared seven years later, cost about $1,000 once you added case and power supply, and only held five or 10 megabytes--but it was a modest 5.25 inches in diameter. Today's PC disk measures 3.5 inches in diameter and holds 200 gigabytes--40,000 times as much as the original PC disk. It costs about $300. You might have used fax--slow, expensive, and ugly, but the technology was established more than a century ago. There were fax (frequently called \"telefax\" or \"telefacsimile\" back then) experiments within library groups as early as the late 1960s, but they were rarely very successful. The pricing problem with scientific, technical, and medical journals was alive and well 30 years ago. Berkeley, for example, carried out a budget-related 10% serials cut in the early 1970s. THE REVOLUTIONARY EVOLUTION Back then we were talking about library networks, but few of us could envision the Internet. We were learning about MARC II, a painful process that took another decade. Libraries learned earlier than most that the computer wasn't magic. No revolution occurred between 1973 and 2003--but for most libraries and librarians, the overall changes could be considered revolutionary. Even then, the crisis-mongers and hypesters were active. If libraries didn't transform themselves using computer-based tools and replacements for the book--microfilm being the replacement of choice--they would disappear. But somehow, despite using boring old books and failing to make every librarian a programmer (another necessary transformation touted a few years later), libraries have survived. The tools have improved, and the core missions remain. ADDED MATERIAL WALT CRAWFORD is a senior analyst at the Research Libraries Group in Mountain View, California.

        "abstract": "At the heart of any discussion of the information sciences, at least when this discussion is held in the English language, lies the problem of the variant, and shifting, set of concepts and meanings of the terms 'library' and 'information'. The term 'information', in particular, has a variety of meanings in different contexts and communities of discourse, providing an excellent example of Wittgenstein's language game. This implies that any terminology built around this central concept is in danger of being constructed on 'shifting sands'. This article outlines, for the English language only, some of these diverse meanings of information, and their consequences for the terminology of the information sciences. It focuses on the variant relationships between information and related concepts, particularly data and knowledge. It also includes an account of the view information taken in the hard and soft methodologies of system science, as well as the new discipline of 'information physics'. From this, some remarks may be made on the changing meanings of the complex terms such as 'information technology' and 'information literacy', as well as those complex terms involving 'management', information management, knowledge management, document management etc. A similar, though shorter, treatment will de given to terminology around the 'library' concept, particularly in view of the change toward viewing a library as an organised virtual information space, rather than physical environment.",

In this study we analyzed nine years log data of a social science digital library to get an overview of the fields, categories, topics and detailed information needs users are interested in. Based on the log data we have built interactive visualizations which give an overview and concurrently let us look at the detailed interests of users. The underlying log data and the created visualizations are then used to analyze user interests at different hierarchical levels and on a temporal view. The results show that there are topical interests of the users in specific fields and topics of the social sciences but at the same time there exists a diversity of different information needs. Based on these findings we analyze in detail the gap between the indexing language of the system used to annotate documents and the language users apply to articulate their information needs.",

Then we generated pathfinder networks of 43 clusters and grouped them into seven subject categories: digital libraries and digital archiving technologies, online resources and finding aids, archives and archivists, legal and political issues, electronic records and technical issues, records and information management, and e-mail and information professionals. Finally, these seven subject categories were merged into three sectors: digital library, archives and RIM (Business). This study describes dynamic change in the 2001--4 research themes from traditional single-subject areas to emerging, complex subject areas. These results also show that research areas in archival sciences have much growth potential and will continue to expand.",

We describe the problem and sketch some possible resolutions. Although the issues are conceptual and foundational the practical significance is real.

        "abstract": "Digital libraries aim at unhindered access to content over computer\n\tand communication networks, and digitization may be taken as a visible\n\tproposition to enhance the shelf life of non-digital content by preservation\n\tapart from the virtue of increased and easy access, thereby furthering\n\tusage. As a fresh, lively and dynamic area with a lot of enthusiasm\n\tand activity by researchers from different disciplines, institutions\n\tand countries, digital libraries are viewed in different perspectives\n\tand the single most development that has brought about sweeping changes\n\tin the library and information discipline currently in the developed\n\tworld is that of digital libraries. Advancements in computer and\n\tinformation technology with breakthroughs in memory technology has\n\tnot only reduced the cost of infrastructure required for hosting\n\tdigital libraries, but the demonstrated success of a wide variety\n\tof projects in USA and Europe also endorsed the chances of their\n\tsurvival even in a developing country. Though the professionals and\n\tlibraries in developing countries are also experiencing the virtues\n\tof Internet, and electronic information highways, many of these libraries\n\thave not gone much farther than the computerization of in-house operations,\n\tavailing databases in electronic media such as CD-ROMs, and web access\n\tof subscribed journals and various free resources. Digital library\n\tdevelopment should be taken up as an additional task to populate\n\tthe web sites with valuable in-house content like the research reports,\n\tpublications of in-house researchers, and so on. Digital library\n\tprojects and developments in the country are so many, though a large\n\tnumber of them are only at an aggressively enthusiastic preliminary\n\tstage. In a country such as India so rich in content of indigenous\n\tresearch and development in disciplines varied from science and technology\n\tto social science, humanities and spirituality, there is tremendous\n\tneed for hosting full fledged digital libraries by appropriately\n\ttagging the content with affordable information technology. However,\n\twhat is lacking, especially in developing countries, is a coordinated\n\tcollaborative approach to bring in institutions and identifying content\n\tvaluable for digitization with sufficient monetary and infrastructure\n\tsupport. The digital library development in the country needs a two-pronged\n\tstrategy (i) to digitize local content, and (ii) to devise options\n\tfor accessing external resources. Channels for internal content include\n\tjournals and serials for research, conference proceedings, theses\n\tand dissertations and preprints, research and status reports, textbooks\n\tand learning materials, government publications, spiritual/heritage\n\tsources, tourism information, traditional knowledge, etc. As far\n\tas external resources are concerned, there are electronic options\n\tfrom publishers and information provides such as, online access through\n\tWeb of subscribed journals, CDs and floppies containing supplementary\n\tmaterial of printed books, bibliographic/full-text databases, which\n\tcan be hosted on library servers or intranet along with local content.\n\tThe problems for digital library development are manifold in India\n\tsuch as lack of interest, non-availability of computer and IT infrastructure\n\tfor library activities, copyright problems, ensuring secure access,\n\tproperly selecting content from the mass available, internet bandwidth,\n\tabsence of sufficient financial support, over concentration of professional\n\ttime on administrative routines, acute shortage over concentration\n\tof professional time on administrative routines, acute shortage of\n\tcompetent manpower, etc. The software boom engulfing the country,\n\tas a result of the big leap in computer penetration, sudden rise\n\tin proficient manpower, and sizable improvement in communication\n\tinfrastructure should also be treated as an asset and taken advantage\n\tof by authorities and information professionals to create and maintain\n\tdigital information facilities to usher in the new information age.",

We explore whether the peaks in the spectrograms generated by Reference Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS) indicate such long-term impact by comparing across RPYS for subsequent time intervals. Multi-RPYS enables us to distinguish between short-term citation peaks at the research front that decay within 10 years versus historically constitutive (long-term) citations that function as concept symbols. Using these constitutive citations, one is able to cluster document sets (e.g., journals) in terms of intellectually shared histories. We test this premise by clustering 40 journals in the Web of Science Category of Information and Library Science using multi-RPYS. It follows that RPYS can not only be used for retrieving roots of sets under study (cited), but also for algorithmic historiography of the citing sets. Significant references are historically rooted symbols among other citations that function as currency.",

An exploratory study was conducted to determine the position and engagements of academic libraries and information science schools in their contributions to scholarly sustainability activities and curricular initiatives. This article presents the results of the study which reveals a number of engagements by library professionals in the areas of sustainability, such as increasing open access to research, building sustainability-related collections and research guides, and incorporating sustainability content into information literacy. While academic libraries and information science schools are engaged in a broad spectrum of initiatives that support their institutions' sustainability research and curricular functions, this study indicates that such activities require a more targeted approach.",
